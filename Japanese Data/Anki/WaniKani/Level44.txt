寸	Kanji	寸	Measurement	radical	Measurement	Measurement		<reading>すん</reading>				すん									The <radical>measurement</radical> radical and the <kanji>measurement</kanji> kanji are exactly the same.	If you make sure to know the radicals, you'll also make sure to know the kanji too, automagically.	You want to <kanji>measure</kanji> something... something that will make you famous. You decide you'll measure the biggest mass in our solar system. We're talking about the <reading>sun</reading> (<ja>すん</ja>).	Imagine yourself deciding to do this. First step is to get a ridiculously long measuring tape. Then, you go up to the <reading>sun</reading> and start measuring. You immediately start getting burned. Feel the pain of the heat from the <reading>sun</reading>. Think about how this really probably wasn't a good idea. You still go forward, though, doing your best to <kanji>measure</kanji> the sun. Ouch, ouch, ouch.		6694	-	kanji Lesson_44
竜	Kanji	竜	Dragon	radical	Dragon	Dragon		<reading>りゅう</reading>	たつ			りゅう	たつ								The <radical>dragon</radical> radical is the same as this kanji, which is <kanji>dragon</kanji>.	Not to <kanji>dragon</kanji> with it, but make sure you know your radicals so you know your kanji!	Imagine a <kanji>dragon</kanji>. You are talking to it, which is already pretty strange, but as you're talking, he turns into the Street Fighter character <reading>Ryuu</reading> (<ja>りゅう</ja>).	"Then imagine after his transformation he attacks you using his Street Fighter moves. ""Hadouken!"""		6695	-	kanji Lesson_44

Picture wolverine and a pig hanging precariously over the edge. One move the wrong way and they'll both go toppling over.	Suddenly, the pig squeals, pulls the thread, and sends them both over the <kanji>edge</kanji>. Straight to their <reading>en</reading>d (<ja>えん</ja>).	If you fall off the edge it'll be your end too.

You put a feather on a rice paddy to create a giant airplane. Flawed, sure. But, this rice paddy + feather is going to be one <kanji>wing</kanji> of your amazing aircraft.	Imagine a <kanji>wing</kanji> that is made of a rice paddy and a feather put together. Doesn't make sense, looks ugly, and probably will not fly. Imagine it anyways. It is your wing.	To make the feather and rice paddy stick together you need some kind of sticking agent. This time we find the original bird that the feather came from and grab its eggs. We break the eggs open and use the <reading>yolk</reading> (<ja>よく</ja>). It's pretty sticky, but still probably not aircraft safe. 	Imagine using the yolks to stick everything together. It's all over your hands, and things are pretty nasty.		6697	-	kanji Lesson_44

Please, just know your radicals. Please!	"When you stab your <kanji>blade</kanji> into an enemy you shout ""<reading>Ha</reading> (<ja>は</ja>)!"" It's just the normal ""thrusting with blade"" sound."

They leave it there, for a long long time. They aren't going to cut you, but you can't move. You have to <kanji>endure</kanji> the pain and uncomfortableness of the situation.	Imagine your chest and ribs are open. There's a blade on your heart. Now try not to move, or your heart will be cut!	This is all a part of your <reading>nin</reading>ja (<ja>にん</ja>) training. You must learn to stay totally still, without breathing. This is how they train you. If you can <kanji>endure</kanji> this you can endure anything, plus you can stay really still, which is good for ninjas.	Just think about how much you want to become a ninja.

Inside is a child who will save the village from demons.	Of course, this tree omen of a <kanji>peach</kanji> refers to momotaro, the little boy who was born from a peach (you should look it up if you don't know this children's story).	"If <reading>momo</reading>taro (<ja>もも</ja>) wasn't enough, think about the <kanji>peach</kanji> growing larger and larger. You want it to grow bigger, so you yell at it: ""<reading>MO</reading>RE! <reading>MO</reading>RE!"" (<ja>もも</ja>)."	"It grows bigger everytime you say ""MORE MORE"" twice. If you say it just once, it stays the same."		6701	-	kanji Lesson_44
辛	Kanji	辛	Spicy	radical	Spicy	Spicy		<reading>しん</reading>	から つら			しん	から, つら								The <radical>spicy</radical> radical and <kanji>spicy</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Hot!		Imagine eating this <kanji>spicy</kanji> food, becoming blinded by the spicy heat, and knocking your <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>) on something while you bumble around.	It's bleeding profusely and really hurts a lot. Plus your mouth is still burning from that spicy food you ate. It's pure agony.		6702	-	kanji Lesson_44

This is a <kanji>riddle</kanji>!	Think carefully and see if you can come up with the answer to my riddle before you read on.	Did you figure out the answer to this <kanji>riddle</kanji>? Say your answer aloud to the screen right now.... <reading>not so</reading> (<ja>なぞ</ja>)! You're wrong.	Did you say the answer to the riddle is that they're both a kilogram? Not so! A scooter is heavier than some rice! And don't you email me saying that's not so! It's my riddle, I can make the answer whatever I want. That's the law of riddles!		6703	-	kanji Lesson_44

It's a <kanji>samurai</kanji>, who protects the monks in return for prayers that keep him safe.	You walk up to a temple and you're surprised to find that there's a samurai guarding it. Talk to him for a while so he can tell you why he has been doing this job. He's quite a nice guy, actually.	The reading is <reading>samurai</reading>, which should be easy enough to remember.	If you know the meaning you know the reading as well! That doesn't happen too often with kanji, so consider yourself lucky!		6704	-	kanji Lesson_44

You should only use it in casual situations or if you're a badass."	Why am <kanji>I</kanji> standing in the middle of this rice paddy with an umbrella? I'm digging for <reading>ore</reading> (<ja>おれ</ja>).	More accurately, I'm standing here with an umbrella so I don't get wet.

Now I have to <kanji>scold</kanji> you.	SEVEN TIMES! You'd think you'd learn.	What were you doing wrong that caused me to <kanji>scold</kanji> you? You were feeding the <ja><reading>鹿</reading></ja> (<ja>しか</ja>). If you feed them they'll never be able to feed themselves!	Imagine yourself feeding the deer, then getting scolded (or you doing the scolding to someone else feeding the deer, whichever works best).		6706	-	kanji Lesson_44

I don't know if you've ever seen Asian pears, but they're pretty big and sturdy. You can't just pick them off of the tree, you need the help of a knife. That's why this is a pear, and not an apple or peach or something else.	Imagine standing below a tree full of pears. You take your knife and carefully cut them all down, one by one.	As you cut the <kanji>pear</kanji>s down, you can't help but <reading>gnash</reading> (<ja>なし</ja>) your teeth. You want to eat these pears right now.

They are the legs attached to a <kanji>small animal</kanji>.	You can only see the legs, though, because a cloth is covering the cage. What kind of small animal is it? Try to look.	You look up through the cloth, and see a hairless cat. This <kanji>small animal</kanji> is hairless, but most surprisingly is covered in <reading>hickie</reading>s (<ja>ひき</ja>).

It's hard for you to talk normally, and even harder for people to understand you unless you shout.	You were born with mouth vines (a rare condition where your mouth is always full of vines), so you've been shouting all your life. And yet people still can't hear you. It's very frustrating.	"You need to <kanji>shout</kanji> so that people can understand you through the mouth vines. You shout, ""<ja><reading>きょう</reading>と</ja>!"" because you hear there is a temple there for people with your condition."	Imagine the word <ja>きょうと</ja> not coming out clearly because of your mouth vines. People can only hear the <ja>きょう</ja> part, so they don't know where you want to go.

It's your <kanji>hair</kanji> and you're so proud of it.	Just feel your hair, it's such a good friend, and you wish it was longer.	Who gave you this hair? Probably the great <ja><reading>神</reading></ja> (<ja>かみ</ja>) of hair. You deserve this great hair.	Pretend to pray to the great hair <ja>神</ja>. What is his reply?

嵐	Kanji	山, 風	Mountain, Wind	radical, radical	Storm	Storm			<reading>あらし</reading>			あらし									The <radical>mountain</radical> <radical>wind</radical> coming down from the mountains is very fierce. It is so fierce it's a lot like a <kanji>storm</kanji>. Well, it is a storm, really.	If you think about it makes sense. Those mountain winds that come down from the mountain are cold and windy and nasty. When they mix with warmer air down below, it creates a nasty <kanji>storm</kanji>.	A <kanji>storm</kanji> is nothing to scoff at. If you get hit by the storm and get all wet and nasty and electrocuted, you're bound to get <reading>a rash</reading> (<ja>あらし</ja>).	The rash comes from being wet and not drying off when you get home. Your skin gets irritated by this moisture.		6716	-	kanji Lesson_44

A bamboo hat is probably one of those hats you think of when you think of rice farmers, a <kanji>conical hat</kanji>.	You know the ones I'm talking about? They're cone-shaped, sort of, and they go on your head, keeping the sun off your face.	"A <kanji>conical hat</kanji> is kind of like an umbrella on your head. What's the reading for ""umbrella"" in Japanese? Why, it's <reading>kasa</reading> (<ja>かさ</ja>)!"	Think about a bamboo umbrella on your head.

Usually when we talk about a can with this kanji we mean a <kanji>tin can</kanji>, though.	Picture a tin can in your mind as clearly as you can.	"The reading for a <kanji>can</kanji> is <ja>かん</ja>, which seems impossibly easy.

"Just imagine a princess saying ""UGH, I'm just like a servant, I have to do all the crap you tell me."" Then, all the servants roll their eyes, because, really, she's a princess, lucky duck."

So, your shelf is made up of a tree and two moons. Imagine this shelf and put things on it. The moons are kind of rolling around, making it hard to build your shelf.	Your moon shelf is great. It's also huge, because moons are really big. That means you can store a <reading>ton-a</reading>-stuff (<ja>たな</ja>) on it.	Think about the ton-a-stuff you're going to put on there.
