That's what you use to write in black!	Make sure the dirt you're using to make black ink is really, really black. Like the kind you find around volcanoes or something.	"Be careful that you don't spill <kanji>black ink</kanji> on anyone or anything. If you do, you have to own it.

These nine birds are a flock of all kinds, but the dove and the pigeon are the leaders.	Look at these nine birds strutting down the street like they own the place. The dove and pigeon are out in front because they are the most important. Hear them chirping and fluttering their feathers about.	Take a look at the <kanji>pigeon</kanji> in front of you. Now, grab it, tear it in half, and grab the <reading>heart</reading> (<ja>はと</ja>) from its little body. 	Devour it. You love pigeon hearts. Discard the rest, keep the heart.		6973	-	kanji Lesson_46
穏	Kanji	禾, <i class=radical-cleat></i>, ヨ, 心	Grain, Cleat, Wolverine, Heart	radical, radical, radical, radical	Calm	Calm		<reading>おん</reading>	おだ			おん	おだ								Some <radical>grains</radical> get stuck in his <radical>cleat</radical>, and <radical>Wolverine</radical>'s <radical>heart</radical> grows <kanji>calm</kanji>. Wolverine had been screaming and yelling and stomping around, but when the grains entered his cleat he realized where he was. He was finally able to calm down.	He's calm now because he stomped right into a farmer's field (thus the rice) and if he didn't calm down he'd probably ruin it.	Now that Wolverine is <kanji>calm</kanji>, tears come to his eyes. Being calm has given him perspective on what his anger has done. Oh, wait no. There are just some <reading>on</reading>ions (<ja>おん</ja>) in his cleats too, and they're making calm tears trickle down his eyes.	Picture Wolverine sitting calmly in this field, onions causing tears to stream down his cheeks as he reflect on what he's done.		6974	-	kanji Lesson_46
鈍	Kanji	金, 屯	Gold, Barracks	radical, radical	Dull	Dull		<reading>どん</reading>	にぶ のろ			どん	にぶ, のろ								Make <radical>barracks</radical> out of <radical>gold</radical> and they will get <kanji>dull</kanji> quickly. Gold is soft, it's okay for jewelry and delicate things that aren't used much, but barracks for soldiers? Those are used constantly, and they get worn out easily. What was once shiny gold will go dull in days.	Picture a huge barracks made of dull, almost brown, gold. Maybe you should have picked a better material.	"As you stare sadly at the <kanji>dull</kanji> barracks, the <reading>don</reading> (<ja>どん</ja>) shows up out of nowhere, and he's pissed. He turns his angry gaze toward you and says, ""How did my barracks get so dull? Are you at fault? This is bad, this is very bad. Someone will pay for this."""	You stand cowering in front of the don as he inspects how dull the gold barracks are. You don't wanna be off'd for this just because the don was dull enough to make you use gold!		6975	-	kanji Lesson_46

This demon is a <kanji>devil</kanji>.	You thought the devil hangs out in hell, but he actually hangs out under this canopy of trees.	Why is the <kanji>devil</kanji> under a canopy of trees? Because he's looking for his <reading>ma</reading>ma (<ja>ま</ja>).	Into the trees is where all mamas go missing. And so the devil searches for his mama under this canopy of trees.		6976	-	kanji Lesson_46
寮	Kanji	宀, 尞	Roof, Charcoal	radical, radical	Dormitory	Dormitory		<reading>りょう</reading>				りょう									You need to bring <radical>charcoal</radical> under this <radical>roof</radical> to heat the <kanji>dormitory</kanji>. You live in this dormitory with a bunch of other kids, and you all have to take turns bringing in the charcoal from outside to heat it.	Imagine looking at a dormitory chore wheel and seeing it's your turn to carry in the charcoal this week. Bleh!	The <kanji>dormitory</kanji> is on an island, so when you go out to get the charcoal you have to take a <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat. You row and row and row until you reach the shed with all the charcoal. Then you row and row and row it back to the dormitory.	The dormitory row boat leaks a little too, so by the time you get back you really need to light the charcoal and heat up!		6977	-	kanji Lesson_46
盆	Kanji	分, 皿	Part, Plate	radical, radical	Lantern Festival, Tray	Lantern Festival, Tray		<reading>ぼん</reading>				ぼん									I found <radical>part</radical> of a <radical>plate</radical> at the <kanji>lantern festival</kanji>, and put it on a <kanji>tray</kanji> to keep it safe. There is a legendary plate broken into three parts. One part of the plate I found was at the lantern festival. The lantern festival was pretty cool, but I’m really glad I found the part of that plate I was looking for.	Imagine holding a tray in your hands with this part of the plate on it, as the light from the lanterns glitters off it and dances around, illuminating the background. It’s enchanting.	The plate part you found at the <kanji>lantern festival</kanji> (and put on the <kanji>tray</kanji>) is made out of <reading>bone</reading> (<ja>ぼん</ja>) china. How fancy. Is bone china made from real bones? Bones found in China? Probably not, huh.	Tap this bone china plate with your knuckle.

The tree is tall and straight and does not have any leaves or branches. The tree is basically a big wooden pillar that just happens to be alive still.	Look at this big tree pillar over in the east. You always know where east is because of it.	That <kanji>pillar</kanji> happens to be in the center of <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. If you need to find east (which is where <ja>とうきょう</ja> is), you just look for the pillar.	Imagine looking down on <ja>とうきょう</ja> from atop this magnificent pillar.

I own these five things, and I keep them in my mouth so people like you cannot take them from me.	What five things would you keep in your mouth to protect them from me? Imagine these five things in your mouth and think of how important they are to you as you taste them on your tongue.	<kanji>Me</kanji>, personally, <kanji>I</kanji> am quite thirsty so I ask for some “<reading>waga</reading>” (<ja>わが</ja>). I have five things in my mouth, so it is hard for me to pronounce the word “water”. So it sounds like “waga” when I ask for it. “Coulg I pweash hab sum waga?! I deed waga!!”	Imagine how you would sound asking for “waga” with your mouth full of five things. You can carry out this experiment in real life if you would like, just be careful not to choke, okay?		6980	-	kanji Lesson_46

This innocent guy is just walking along the road when you drive up to him in your car and axe him to death with your axe. You’re all like, VROOM! AXE! Now this guy is dead because you sliced him down in cold blood.	Imagine driving your car, waving your axe out the window and slicing this guy down. Hear his scream ring in your ears as you slice, slice, SLICE.	You were driving around in <reading>Zan</reading>zibar (<ja>ざん</ja>) when you <kanji>slice</kanji>d down this man. Luckily, Zanzibar has no laws at all, so you won’t get arrested for slicing down this guy with your axe.	Zanzibar is a crazy place, huh?

Would you rather have your heart up on the roof, close to falling but out of the way of people. Or would you rather have your heart in a net, which people can't steal from, but is in the way of cars.	As you try to decide which you'd <kanji>rather</kanji> have, your <reading>neigh</reading>bors (<ja>ねい</ja>) come out and grab the heart out of your hands.

Imagine this odd tree <kanji>chair</kanji> being the most comfortable chair you've ever sat on. It's shaped perfectly for you, and the moss makes it soft. Wow, what a chair.	But, this odd tree <kanji>chair</kanji> is also home to an <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>). It swoops down upon you as you sit down, gouging your eyes out.	"Feel the fear and regret.

"When you ask him how many <kanji>years old</kanji> he is, he turns to you and screams, ""I'M A MILLION YEARS OLD AND YOU'LL NEVER STOP ME!"" That's obviously not how old this kid is, so you take out your holy blue <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) and slice the slide in half. Then the jackhammer. Then the kid's metal arm—wait!

The capital was already a pretty cool temperature, but with the addition of the water from the tsunami, the capital is now very cool.	Imagine being in the capital. The tsunami hits and now you are all wet. You are also very cool because the water is not warm. You are cool and wet. How sad.	You don’t like how <kanji>cool</kanji> it is in the capital now so you decide to get in your <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat and row away to some place that is not so cool.

Monkeys are naughty little things. You should be happy it was just dirt it kicked into your mouth, and not something worse.	Imagine looking at a monkey at the zoo. Aww, it's so cute. But then it turns around and kicks some dirt right into your aww-ing mouth. Yuck! Why monkey, why?!	You spit the dirt out of your mouth and look back at the <kanji>monkey</kanji> to see that it's <reading>salu</reading>ting (<ja>さる</ja>) you. Is... is it mocking you?

But you're a go with the flow type of person, thanks to all the yoga, so you make a new one!	This <kanji>key</kanji> has to be perfect, because if it isn't the <reading>ca</reading>r <reading>gui</reading>llotine (<ja>かぎ</ja>) will come down and chop off your hand!

Figure out what you need to do to make sure you follow these rain orders successfully. Zero spill, alright?	The best way to make sure there is <kanji>zero</kanji> <kanji>spill</kanji> when it rains is to get rid of the rain. You use a special <reading>ray</reading> (<ja>れい</ja>) gun and zap the rain right out of the sky. There will be zero spills because there will be zero rain.	"You just take your ray gun and ""zap!"" the clouds are gone. There will be zero spills today.

Imagine if you had a habit of eating hot peppers whenever you thought you might be getting sick. To be fair, it flushes out your sinuses and tastes good, so it's not the worst habit you could have.	Everyone you know has a different <kanji>habit</kanji> when they get sick. Instead, they eat <reading>cous</reading>cous (<ja>くせ</ja>). But you think couscous is gross.

You haven’t sold enough gold to own a smithy as nice as this one yet, so for now, you rent one. It is pretty swanky though, even for a rental.	Imagine yourself in this rental smithy. It’s really nice. There’s like TVs and live music and free WiFi and everything. It’s a very nice rental in which to do tempering.

When you want to harvest the <kanji>head of the plant</kanji> you'd like to eat, you need to use a <reading>hoe</reading> (<ja>ほ</ja>).

Whenever someone walks into your bathroom, you start screaming that you are the sovereign ruler of this toilet, this sink, this toothbrush, and all that touch these tiles.	As the <kanji>sovereign</kanji> ruler of this bathroom, you must choose a monogram to represent your rule.
