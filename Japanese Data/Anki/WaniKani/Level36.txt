甘	Radical				Sweet	Sweet															This radical is the sun with its hair sticking out. Why is the sun's hair sticking out like this? It ate wayyy too many <radical>sweet</radical> things causing it to have too much energy, making its hair stand on end. It also kind of looks like a sweet, sweet candy with the wrapper sticking out. Remember it how you'd like.					5512	-	Lesson_36 radical

鮭	Kanji	魚, 土	Fish, Dirt	radical, radical	Salmon	Salmon			<reading>さけ</reading> <reading>しゃけ</reading>			さけ, しゃけ									What kind of <radical>fish</radical> jumps from <radical>dirt</radical> to <radical>dirt</radical>? A <kanji>salmon</kanji>!	When you're at the river watching salmon jumping up stream, they keep jumping onto the dirt, flopping back into the water, then doing it again.	You make a drinking game out of watching the <kanji>salmon</kanji> going up stream. Every time one jumps onto the dirt, you drink a shot of <reading><ja>酒</ja></reading> (<ja>さけ</ja>). You realize you're drunk when you ask for more <ja>さけ</ja> but it comes out as <reading><ja>しゃけ</ja></reading>.	"Salmon. Drink <ja>さけ</ja>. Salmon. Drink <ja>さけ</ja>. Salmon. Drink...  ""Ughhh....

旧	Kanji	<i class=radical-stick></i>, 日	Stick, Sun	radical, radical	Former	Former		<reading>きゅう</reading>				きゅう									There’s a <radical>stick</radical> next to the <radical>sun</radical>, reflecting on its <kanji>former</kanji> glory. The stick used to be a great tree, and the stick thinks that if it stays by the sun long enough it might return to its former form as a towering tree.	Pretend you are the stick. Really focus on your former self as you feel the sun warm you with its rays. Imagine yourself growing, larger and larger.	It's working, it's working! The stick is returning to its <kanji>former</kanji> state and... w-wuh? It sprouted a <reading>cu</reading>cumber (<ja>きゅう</ja>).	I guess this stick was formerly a cucumber tree. Or maybe it just tried so hard it pooped a cucumber. I don't care which one is true, you pick whatever you want to believe.		5516	-	kanji Lesson_36
姓	Kanji	女, 生	Woman, Life	radical, radical	Surname, Family Name	Surname, Family Name, Last Name		<reading>せい</reading> <reading>しょう</reading>				せい, しょう									That special <radical>woman</radical> in your <radical>life</radical> will eventually take your <kanji>surname</kanji> and make it her <kanji>family name</kanji> too. Traditionally, a woman will change her last name when she gets married and keep that name for the rest of her life. Her husband’s family name becomes her family name too.	Imagine having your surname changed for the rest of your life. How do you feel about having a different family name? Is it a big deal to you or does it not matter much?	Picture this special woman in your mind. She's changing her <kanji>surname</kanji> to yours and taking hold of your special <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) as well. And it's... it's splitting in two!	Now you share a family name AND a holy blue saber! You can protect your legacy (and surname) hand in hand and saber in saber. (Or something like that.)		5517	-	kanji Lesson_36
貿	Kanji	ム, 刀, 貝	Private, Sword, Shellfish	radical, radical, radical	Trade	Trade		<reading>ぼう</reading>				ぼう									You send your <radical>private</radical> <radical>sword</radical> man out with your <radical>shellfish</radical> so he can <kanji>trade</kanji> them. Shellfish were used as currency back in the olden days. And you aren't going to go out trading and dirty your own hands, no no. Trading your shellfish is the job for the private sword you hired!	Imagine your private sword holding a big bag of shellfish and going off to market to trade them.	While he's out making the <kanji>trade</kanji> for you, you decide to relax and do some <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>). In fact, you can't wait for the trade to be done because you're hoping he's going to come back with a new bowling ball for you.	Oh boy, I hope my private sword trades my shellfish for that new bowling ball I heard about!		5518	-	kanji Lesson_36
将	Kanji	将	Commander	radical	Commander	Commander		<reading>しょう</reading>				しょう									The <radical>commander</radical> radical and the <kanji>commander</kanji> kanji are the same!	Know your radicals, yo!	Who is the <kanji>commander</kanji> of Japan? The <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>)! And if you ever say anyone else or vote for someone else or even THINK about someone else being the commander, he'll find you and cut off your head.	You better remember the Shougun is the commander of everything... or else...		5519	-	kanji Lesson_36

I know you like things that are bright, and I know you like plates too. Therefore, this bright plate should be more than enough to convince you to enter into an alliance with me.	Look at this bright plate. Look at it. It’s awesome. It’s blinding. Hold it in your hands. Marvel at it. Wow. This plate is sweet.	The person you are trying to get in an <kanji>alliance</kanji> with you is the captain of the <reading>May</reading>flower (<ja>めい</ja>). You want to be in an alliance with the captain of the Mayflower because you really like boats. You want to ride on the Mayflower like, so bad.	This Mayflower boat is the best boat you ever did see. Hear the ocean around it as it bobs in the water, full sails billowing in the wind. Boats are cool.		5520	-	kanji Lesson_36
遺	Kanji	⻌, 貴	Scooter, Valuable	radical, radical	Leave Behind	Leave Behind		<reading>い</reading>	のこ			い	のこ								When you go on a <radical>scooter</radical>, anything <radical>valuable</radical>, you need to <kanji>leave behind</kanji>.	Rings, necklaces, wallets, phones? Don't take them on a scooter. Leave behind all that valuable stuff!	Anything you don't <kanji>leave behind</kanji> will be stolen by <reading>ea</reading>gles (<ja>い</ja>). Eagles like shiny, valuable things, especially ones that are bouncing around on you while you scoot by on a scooter.	If you keep too many of your valuables on you, the eagles might not leave you behind either! They'll just pick you up off the scooter and carry you and your valuables off to their nests!		5521	-	kanji Lesson_36
伸	Kanji	ｲ, 申	Leader, Humble	radical, radical	Stretch	Stretch		しん	<reading>の</reading>			の	しん								A <radical>leader</radical> who's <radical>humble</radical> will <kanji>stretch</kanji> in front of everyone. They'll show that they have to get up every hour or so and stretch just like the rest of us.	The leader is humble and human, just like the rest of us, and has to stretch to stay healthy too. He's not some kind of god!	The leader is currently working hard to <kanji>stretch</kanji> in front of all of you, and as he does, he munches on some <reading>no</reading>ri (<ja>の</ja>) seaweed snacks. Then he starts stretching the nori too.	Watch as the leader stretches his body and the nori seaweed. He takes a bite, stretches the other way, then stretches out a piece for you to eat too. How humble of him!		5522	-	kanji Lesson_36
債	Kanji	ｲ, 責	Leader, Blame	radical, radical	Debt	Debt		<reading>さい</reading>				さい									Your <radical>leader</radical> gets the <radical>blame</radical> if your company is in <kanji>debt</kanji>. They're the one who led you all into that debt, so they should get the blame too.	Picture the leader standing up in front of everyone as they blame him. He's holding a plaque with the amount of debt you're all in. Try to imagine what that number would be.	To pay off this <kanji>debt</kanji> your leader says you need to sell your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>) to help the company. You fight him! You yell! You scream! The cyborg puts a half-human half-robot hand on your shoulder and shakes its head sadly.	Watch as your cyborg saves your company, even though it wasn't even his responsibility, from crippling debt. *sob* I can't believe your cyborg is gone!		5523	-	kanji Lesson_36
及	Kanji	及	Escalator	radical	Reach	Reach		<reading>きゅう</reading>	およ			きゅう	およ								<radical>Escalator</radical>s are used to <kanji>reach</kanji> things.	Imagine yourself on an escalator. What is up above that you’re trying to reach?	You're riding the escalator trying to <kanji>reach</kanji> a delicious <reading>cu</reading>cumber (<ja>きゅう</ja>).	Cucumbers grow on trees sometimes, so you need to take escalators to get up there and reach them.		5524	-	kanji Lesson_36
奈	Kanji	大, 示	Big, Jackhammer	radical, radical	Nara	Nara		<reading>な</reading>				な									There is a <radical>big</radical> <radical>jackhammer</radical> in <kanji>Nara</kanji>. That jackhammer is the biggest in all the land and is on display in Nara, Japan.	Look at this big jackhammer. Look at it. It’s so big. Also it’s in Nara. Imagine being in Nara and looking at this big jackhammer. You’re all like, dang – that’s a big jackhammer.	What’s the first part of <kanji>Nara</kanji>? <reading>Na</reading> (<ja>な</ja>). Well that’s easy.	Just keep in mind what the first part of Nara is. The first part of Nara is “na” so you’ll have no trouble remembering this one.		5525	-	kanji Lesson_36
幅	Kanji	巾, 畐	Towel, Scarecrow	radical, radical	Width	Width		ふく	<reading>はば</reading>			はば	ふく								You want to put this <radical>towel</radical> over this <radical>scarecrow</radical>, but you have to measure its <kanji>width</kanji> first. If the towel doesn't have a greater width than the scarecrow, some of it will be showing. Which you definitely don't want.	The scarecrow creeps you out. You don't want to look at it anymore, so you're standing eerily close to it measuring its width, so you can hide it forever.	You finish measuring the <kanji>width</kanji> of the scarecrow and the width of the towel, and you realize you're the width of a <reading>haba</reading>nero (<ja>はば</ja>) pepper short. This is fine, you grow those. This is a whole field of habaneros! So you pluck one off the nearest plant, tape it to the cloth, and cover that scarecrow right up.	Do you know the width of a habanero? It's one scarecrow minus one cloth.		5526	-	kanji Lesson_36
廃	Kanji	广, 発	Canopy, Departure	radical, radical	Obsolete	Obsolete		<reading>はい</reading>	すた			はい	すた								This <radical>canopy</radical>, after your <radical>departure</radical>, will become <kanji>obsolete</kanji>. The canopy was here to protect you, but no one will need it once you're gone.	During your departure you look back at the obsolete canopy just once. It's standing there, still and alone. It's a really sad sight.	When something becomes <kanji>obsolete</kanji>, you must write a <reading>hai</reading>ku (<ja>はい</ja>). Honestly, the best haiku are about something ending, so this is perfect.	My sweet canopy I don't need you anymore You are obsolete		5527	-	kanji Lesson_36
甘	Kanji	甘	Sweet	radical	Sweet	Sweet		かん	<reading>あま</reading>			あま	かん								The <radical>sweet</radical> radical and the <kanji>sweet</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Double sweet.		The <kanji>sweet</kanji>, sweet sensation is almost overwhelming. You gotta put on some sweet resistant <reading>armor</reading> (<ja>あま</ja>) to protect you from all that sweetness. The armor will prevent you from having a sweet, sweet sweetness overload.	Put on the armor! Feel its weight on your body. Now taste the sweet flavor on your tongue. It’s sweet, but not too sweet.		5528	-	kanji Lesson_36
換	Kanji	扌, 勹, 口, 儿, 大	Fingers, Prison, Mouth, Legs, Big	radical, radical, radical, radical, radical	Exchange	Exchange		<reading>かん</reading>	か			かん	か								In <radical>prison</radical>, when you have access to a <radical>big</radical> number of <radical>fingers</radical>, <radical>mouth</radical>s, and <radical>legs</radical> you can <kanji>exchange</kanji> them for things that are worth more to you. What are you gonna do with all these body parts in prison? You should exchange them for cigarettes and toilet alcohol.	You just have so many fingers, mouths, and legs you've pummeled off of the other prisoners. Exchange them for better loot!	You learned this type of <kanji>exchange</kanji> from the mighty Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>). You read a book or watched a show about him once and you're pretty positive that Genghis Khan would exchange the body parts of his enemies all over the continents of Asia and Europe for nicer stuff.	Think back to when you were a kid and they would roll out those TVs on stands into the classrooms. Imagine watching a documentary on Genghis Khan's exchange routes where he bought and sold body parts. Educational!		5529	-	kanji Lesson_36
摘	Kanji	扌, 啇	Fingers, Mohawk	radical, radical	Pluck	Pluck		<reading>てき</reading>	つ			てき	つ								Stick your <radical>fingers</radical> in your <radical>mohawk</radical> and <kanji>pluck</kanji> each hair out, one by one.	Imagine plucking the hairs out of your mohawk with your fingers. It's kind of hard to grab onto them at first, but eventually you're plucking them like it's nothing.	"You want to <kanji>pluck</kanji> all your mohawk hair out because you're a <reading>techie</reading> (<ja>てき</ja>), and everyone at your techie job keeps making fun of you for your hair choices. ""Techies should be bald!"" your boss screamed. So here you are, plucking your hair out to fit in."	You didn't realize techies were so inclusive... but they just plucked and plucked at your self-esteem, until you decided to pluck your hair out of your own head.		5530	-	kanji Lesson_36
核	Kanji	木, 亥	Tree, Slice	radical, radical	Nucleus	Nucleus		<reading>かく</reading>				かく									You take a <radical>tree</radical> and <radical>slice</radical> it until you reach its <kanji>nucleus</kanji>. To get to the nucleus of the tree you have to make many a slice, but it’s possible.	Imagine slicing this tree smaller and smaller until you finally get to the nucleus of it. It’s super tiny so you have to view it in a microscope. What does it look like?	It looks like a <reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>). And by cock I mean a male chicken – a rooster. Why does the <kanji>nucleus</kanji> of a tree look like a cock? Science is weird.	Look at this tree nucleus that looks like a cock. While you’re watching it, the nucleus goes “Cock-a-doodle-doo!”		5531	-	kanji Lesson_36
沖	Kanji	氵, 中	Tsunami, Middle	radical, radical	Open Sea	Open Sea		ちゅう	<reading>おき</reading>			おき	ちゅう								There is a <radical>tsunami</radical> in the <radical>middle</radical> of the <kanji>open sea</kanji>. Luckily there are no ships around, so the tsunami in the middle of the open sea is not damaging to anyone.	Look at this tsunami in the middle of the open sea. When the tsunami isn’t destroying things and is just out there in the open sea it looks really majestic and pretty.	Someone dares you to go out to the <kanji>open sea</kanji> and surf on the middle of the tsunami. “<reading>Oki</reading> (<ja>おき</ja>) doki,” you reply. You can’t refuse a dare. Every time someone dares you to do something, you always respond with “oki doki”.	You really regret saying oki doki this time. You don’t want to surf on a tsunami in the middle of the open sea. Imagine doing so. It’s terrifying and wet and you don’t even know how to surf. You’re going to die.		5532	-	kanji Lesson_36
縄	Kanji	糸, 亀	Thread, Turtle	radical, radical	Rope	Rope		<reading>じょう</reading>	なわ			じょう	なわ								Someone <radical>thread</radical>ed a <radical>turtle</radical> into long skinny pieces, making a <kanji>rope</kanji>.	A rope made of threaded turtles. Go ahead and grab onto it and see how it feels. A little rough, but strong.	The person making these threaded turtle <kanji>rope</kanji>s is the local giant farmhand <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>). You watch him stretch and peel pieces of turtle off of turtles, then thread them together into a rope.	Besides being awful, where did Jourm learn to thread turtles into ropes? Why does he have so many turtles despite living on such an inland farm? These are nice ropes that Jourm is making though, and you kind of want to buy some.		5533	-	kanji Lesson_36
津	Kanji	氵, 聿	Tsunami, Brush	radical, radical	Haven	Haven		しん	<reading>つ</reading>			つ	しん								When a <radical>tsunami</radical> comes, the <radical>brush</radical> makes a good safe <kanji>haven</kanji>. Thick brush is a haven from tsunamis because the brush will break the tsunami water and keep you safe and dry.	Imagine being in the haven of a brush while a tsunami strikes. Hear the water crash and rush all around you while you remain safe in your haven.	The only downside about this <kanji>haven</kanji> is that there’s only room for <reading>two</reading> (<ja>つ</ja>) people in the brush. The brush isn’t big enough for more than two people, so unless you have a lot of brush, you won’t be saving many people from the tsunami.	Since there is room for two people in the brush, imagine yourself in the haven with one other person. They and you make two. The other person is a real whiner though - imagine them crying the whole time.		5534	-	kanji Lesson_36

None of the other dogs in the North, East, or West offered you anything.	It is well known that dogs in the South are famous for their kindness and hospitality. It's customary to always offer something when a guest arrives.	The South Dog <kanji>offer</kanji>s you the services of <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>) the samurai as you traverse his lands.	Ken offers to carry you, too. Imagine him offering this. You can choose whether or not to accept in your mind.		5535	-	kanji Lesson_36

Okay, so maybe you shouldn't feed it directly to them, but charcoal has amazing water filtration powers. So put charcoal in their water and the water will heal them right up.	Imagine being sick. Like sick as a dog sick. And then you take some charcoal, put it into your drinking water, and then you're healed!	You aren't the only one that needs to be <kanji>heal</kanji>ed, so you take your <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat out onto the lake where your town gets its drinking water and you dump a bunch of charcoal into it! Now everyone will be healed when they drink.	Picture yourself rowing your row boat into the lake with huge chunks of solid charcoal.

He's convinced his parents are going to try to keep some of his inheritance from him, so he's linking it all together so it can't go anywhere.	Picture this lion surrounded by the thousands of grains of rice he'll inherit from his parents. He's carefully threading them all together.	If you're going to <kanji>inherit</kanji> something from your parents, try to convince them to make it <reading>ca</reading>ke (<ja>けい</ja>), not rice. A single cake is much easier to keep track of and probably tastier (though it will be super stale by the time they die).	I'd much rather inherit a cake than a ton of hard to keep track of rice, like this poor lion.		5537	-	kanji Lesson_36
維	Kanji	糸, 隹	Thread, Turkey	radical, radical	Maintain	Maintain		<reading>い</reading>				い									You tie a piece of <radical>thread</radical> to your <radical>turkey</radical> in order to <kanji>maintain</kanji> proximity to it. The turkey likes to run away, so you tie a thread to it. This way you can hold the other end and maintain your turkey.	Imagine holding onto a thread that is attached to a turkey. Feel the turkey tug against the thread as you struggle to maintain control.	The reason the turkey is struggling is because there’s an <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) swooping down to attack the turkey. You try to <kanji>maintain</kanji> control, but once you see the eagle as well, you let go of the thread.	Now you and the turkey and the eagle are all bumbling about in pandemonium. You try to maintain order but it’s not possible. What a kerfuffle.		5538	-	kanji Lesson_36

If you want to do the nothing dance, just clear your head so there's nothing in it, and then dance!	To help you do this <kanji>dance</kanji> you need some <reading>boo</reading>ze (<ja>ぶ</ja>).

You can't rise to the rank of branch leader if you don't perform a certain number of deeds! Most of them good, I hope.	Picture the leader of your branch doing deeds around your office. Pulling out chairs for people sitting down, emptying the trash, balancing spreadsheets. All good deeds.	The <kanji>deed</kanji> he's currently working on is finding your lost <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). He doesn't have to help, you're the one who lost your own house-combination-car key. But he's so used to doing deeds, he can't help but help.	Picture him doing this deed. He's crawling around on the floor looking for your key.

Stepping on the ground when it's been baking in the hot sun can burn your feet, so you're careful to make them wet with water before stepping outside even once.	Imagine each step on hot, sun-baked asphalt. The water under your feet sizzles, leaving steaming footprints where you stepped from.	Each <kanji>step</kanji> you take brings you closer to <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. Unfortunately, the sun keeps getting hotter, meaning you have to take breaks between steps more often, to get your feet wet with even more water. But you're determined to reach <ja>とうきょう</ja>, no matter how many steps it takes.	Each step is taking you closer to <ja>とうきょう</ja>.

In general, you can assume a boat will have a weapon, but not all of them will. 	<kanji>Generally</kanji> a boat with a weapon will be owned by <reading>Han</reading> (<ja>はん</ja>) Solo.

A bundle of geoducks will never lie, never let you down, and never disappoint you. You can trust them completely.	While you can <kanji>trust</kanji> a bundle of geoducks, never ever trust <reading>rye</reading> (<ja>らい</ja>) bread.	Imagine a bundle of geoducks and a piece rye bread.

The leader needs his clothes to make him look like a leader. The leader has become more reliant on his clothes than he is on his actual skills as a leader!	Imagine this leader in his clothes. Look how reliant he is on them. Imagine what he would be without his clothes – nothing! And also, naked.	The leader has become so <kanji>reliant</kanji> on his clothes that his judgment has been clouded. His kingdom has become infested with <reading>ea</reading>gles (<ja>い</ja>) but the leader does nothing, trusting that his clothes will rout out the eagles if it is something that needs to be done. He’s become so reliant on his clothes that he’s started to become not so good a leader anymore.	Look at the leader as he shouts at his clothes he’s become so reliant on to do something.

You walk forward, about to call out to the <kanji>deer</kanji>, when a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>) suddenly appears out of no where and runs the deer over! Was this all just a trap set up to murder the deer?!	Deer get hit by cars all the time, but it was still really shocking . I mean it was right in front of you.
