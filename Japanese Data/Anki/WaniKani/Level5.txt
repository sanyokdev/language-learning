氵	Radical				Tsunami	Tsunami															You've seen one drop (<ja>丶</ja>), but what happens when you triple this and have three drops, which happens to be the maximum number of drops you can have? You end up with a devastating <radical>tsunami</radical>, because there's too much water and nowhere for it to go. Just think of this as a lot of water. When you have a lot of water, you have a tsunami.					541	-	Lesson_5 radical
耂	Radical				Coffin	Coffin															See the slide going into the dirt? That's where they throw your body when you die. It's actually a <radical>coffin</radical>!					542	-	Lesson_5 radical
ヨ	Radical				Wolverine	Wolverine															You know <radical>Wolverine</radical> from the X-Men? He has three claws that come out of his hand whenever he needs to fight, not at all unlike the radical you see here.					543	-	Lesson_5 radical
廾	Radical				Twenty	Twenty, 20															You have <ja>十</ja> plus <ja>十</ja>... what do you get when you add these two kanji together? You get <radical>twenty</radical>.					544	-	Lesson_5 radical
毋	Radical				Window	Window															See the criss-cross in the pseudo-square shape? That's the frames of a big <radical>window</radical> you can look out of. It's not perfectly shaped like a rice field, it's more artistic. That's why this is a window and <ja>田</ja> is not.					545	-	Lesson_5 radical
肉	Radical				Meat	Meat															"Inside your head, you can only think about people, people, and more people. This is bad, because really all you want is their <radical>meat</radical>, because you're some kind of sick cannibal... you monster. When you think of ""people"" in your head, you're really just thinking about more meat you can eat."					546	-	Lesson_5 radical
自	Radical				Self	Self															That little fleck / drop on your eye is what makes you unique. It's what makes you your <radical>self</radical>. It's you, you know?					547	-	Lesson_5 radical
色	Radical				Color	Color, Colour															The bed you get in prison is the only thing with <radical>color</radical> you'll see while you're there. Picture a dark, dank cell. Maybe a toilet too. Now picture a bright, colorful bed against the wall. This is the only joy you have.					548	-	Lesson_5 radical
行	Radical				Go	Go															You have the radicals for loiter, two, and barb. Someone who uses two barbs on you while you're loitering really wants you to <radical>GO</radical>!! GO on, stop loitering outside of my convenience store, ya dang kids!					549	-	Lesson_5 radical
西	Radical				West	West															"You have pi coming out of a mouth. ""3.14,"" it says. We must take the secret of the circle with us, away from here. We must go to a magical place where nobody will persecute us for our math... a place to the <radical>West</radical>!"					550	-	Lesson_5 radical
可	Radical				Lip Ring	Lip Ring															There's something hooked going into a mouth. Rather than a hook, though, it's a <radical>lip ring</radical>. They used to use fish hooks and nails in the old days. (Glad we don't live in those times anymore!)					551	-	Lesson_5 radical
⻌	Radical				Scooter	Scooter, Water Slide															This radical is a <radical>scooter</radical>. See the handlebars and the little light? And there's a platform at the bottom you can stand or sit on (if it's one of those nice motorized ones).					552	-	Lesson_5 radical
斤	Radical				Axe	Axe, Ax															"This is a strange looking axe, I know. But think of it this way: the letter ""T"" is in the cliff. What is the ""T""? Of course it has to be Mr. T, who's super awesome. Think of Mr. T wielding a terrifying axe, running after you screaming, ""I pity the fool!"" while trying to chop you down. That makes for a pretty terrifying <radical>axe</radical>."					553	-	Lesson_5 radical
言	Radical				Say	Say															There are a bunch of sound waves coming out of a mouth. Those waves represent the things you <radical>say</radical>.					554	-	Lesson_5 radical
金	Radical				Gold	Gold															There's two sets of spikes underneath that hat. It's actually a trap, to prevent anyone from coming in and stealing your <radical>gold</radical>. Why else would you make a trap? Everyone likes to protect their gold.					555	-	Lesson_5 radical
雨	Radical				Rain	Rain															The towel is getting soaked with drops of liquid. That's because it's <radical>rain</radical>ing. Get your towels and other clothes inside before they get soaked through from this rain!					556	-	Lesson_5 radical
青	Radical				Blue	Blue															You have life on top of the moon (ignore that life is missing its little slide on the left side). What would life on the moon look like? Well, first of all, they have no air, so they probably look pretty <radical>blue</radical> from asphyxiation. When you meet them, it turns out you're right. They're a civilization of blue people. Imagine them all living up there, being blue and Smurfy.					557	-	Lesson_5 radical
冋	Radical				Mustache	Mustache, Moustache															See the <radical>mustache</radical> going around the mouth? I wish I could grow a sweet mustache like this.					558	-	Lesson_5 radical
乍	Radical				Key	Key															This is a very oddly shaped <radical>key</radical>, but it's a key nonetheless.					559	-	Lesson_5 radical
冫	Radical				Ice	Ice															"Remember the radical for drop (of liquid)? This is two drops instead of one. When you see two drops, you should think, ""the next stage of water."" What is the next stage? Why, that is <radical>ice</radical>."					560	-	Lesson_5 radical
走	Radical				Run	Run															See the person <radical>run</radical>ning? Don't confuse this with foot (<ja>足</ja>), though. The head is just a streak because this person is running so fast.					561	-	Lesson_5 radical
里	Radical				Village	Village, Sunflower															This is a rice paddy with dirt around it. This is the perfect place to set up a <radical>village</radical>. You have a place to farm and some dirt to live on. What else could you need?					562	-	Lesson_5 radical
会	Radical				Meet	Meet															Under the hat there are two people <radical>meet</radical>ing in private. Look at them huddled up in there. They must have a reason to want to meet in such a private place, but that's not for you to judge. Maybe next time you have to meet with someone you'll hide under a hat with them too.					563	-	Lesson_5 radical
开	Radical				Lantern	Lantern															Think of an old-style <radical>lantern</radical>. It's on top of a few legs (you can only see two from this angle) and it's in a box shaped holder at the top. You can imagine these lining the streets before electricity, right? That's why this radical is a lantern.					564	-	Lesson_5 radical
羽	Radical				Feathers	Feathers															This radical already looks like a pair of wings, right? What are on wings? Well, usually lots of <radical>feathers</radical>.					565	-	Lesson_5 radical
<i class=radical-viking></i>	Radical				Viking	Viking															This is a roof with extra spikes / horns on it. Who was famous for having spiked roofs, spiked helmets, spiked boats?! The Vikings! That's why this is the <radical>Viking</radical> radical.					566	-	Lesson_5 radical
<i class=radical-kick></i>	Radical				Kick	Kick															These are legs that are bending funny. They're bending so they can <radical>kick</radical> you! Imagine someone doing a flying kick at you. Look at their legs and, ah yes, it looks just like this!					567	-	Lesson_5 radical
兄	Kanji	口, 儿	Mouth, Legs	radical, radical	Older Brother, Big Brother, Elder Brother	Older Brother, Big Brother, Elder Brother		<reading>きょう</reading>	あに にい			きょう	あに, にい								Who's someone who's just a <radical>mouth</radical> with <radical>legs</radical>? That's your know-it-all <kanji>older brother</kanji>, who won't shut up about anything.	To help this mnemonic along, literally imagine your older brother as someone that's just a giant mouth with a pair of legs walking around. It talks and talks and talks, too, irritating you. Feel the irritation specifically at your older brother. He's older than you, so you can't beat him up... yet.	You wish you could box your loud-mouth <kanji>older brother</kanji> up and send him far away to <ja><reading>きょう</reading>と</ja>. <ja>きょうと</ja> is super far away from where you currently live, so just ship your older bro off so he can never bother you again.	Hmm... don't you want to go to <ja>きょうと</ja> someday? Maybe you should have sent your brother somewhere less cool.		568	-	kanji Lesson_5
皮	Kanji	丿, 支	Slide, Branch	radical, radical	Skin	Skin		<reading>ひ</reading>	かわ			ひ	かわ								<radical>Slide</radical> down a <radical>branch</radical> and your <kanji>skin</kanji> will come off. Unlike what Tarzan will make you believe, you can't just slide around on branches, they're rough and painful and if you do it your skin will come sliding off and it will hurt.	Imagine sliding down a slide made of a big, branch. The branch's bark digs into your skin and pulls it right off of your body.	Without your <kanji>skin</kanji> to protect you, you feel the full <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>) from the friction of your body going down the branch slide.	Your skin protects you from really feeling lots of heat. It gets burned before you and it has many tiny layers to keep you safe from heat generating things like the sun. You really need your skin!		569	-	kanji Lesson_5
交	Kanji	亠, 父	Lid, Father	radical, radical	Mix, Mingle	Mix, Mingle		<reading>こう</reading>	まじ ま か			こう	まじ, ま, か								You put a <radical>lid</radical> on your <radical>father</radical>. But, he won't taste good alone, so you <kanji>mix</kanji> in some other ingredients. They <kanji>mingle</kanji> inside the pot with him.	This may seem traumatic, but actually your father is surprisingly into it. Imagine him mixed in with all kinds of other things. It's important to note that this kanji is about things being mixed in, not so much about the action of mixing. That's another kanji. 	With a <kanji>mix</kanji> of your father and other ingredients <kanji>mingl</kanji>ing in your cooking pot, you lift up the lid... your father pops up. Your father is <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>. He stares back at you with a big smile.	"""I love mixing in with potatoes and tomatoes,"" your father <ja>こういち</ja> states. ""Turn up that temperature. I like to mingle with a bit more tingle."""		570	-	kanji Lesson_5
会	Kanji	会	Meet	radical	Meet	Meet		<reading>かい</reading>	あ			かい	あ								The <radical>meet</radical> radical and the <kanji>meet</kanji> kanji are the same!	Know your radicals, yo!	What better way to <kanji>meet</kanji> new people than to start <reading>ka</reading>yaking (<ja>かい</ja>)! Get into your kayak and just float out into the water. You'll eventually bump into someone else in a kayak and boom, you're meeting someone new!	"""I met my soulmate in a kayak,"" said Koichi."		571	-	kanji Lesson_5
光	Kanji	<i class=radical-triceratops></i>, 兀	Triceratops, Pi	radical, radical	Sunlight, Light	Sunlight, Light		<reading>こう</reading>	ひかり ひか			こう	ひかり, ひか								You see a <radical>triceratops</radical> in the distance. But, it's odd. It's perfectly <radical>pi</radical> shaped (that is, circular). Some kind of piceratops, if you will. The reason they are this shape is because they want to absorb as much <kanji>sunlight</kanji> (or just <kanji>light</kanji> is fine, too) as possible. They evolved to be round so they don't have any corners casting a shadow.	Absorbing sunlight is natural for reptiles, after all. And a round one can absorb even more light. Imagine it sitting in a round spot of sun, enjoying the warmth. What a rare sight you've come across!	As you watch this majestic beast absorbing <kanji>sunlight</kanji>, suddenly several dozen feral (<ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>)s burst from various hiding spots, spears in hand. Oh no! Those <ja>こういち</ja>s are hunting this rare piceratops!	Imagine many different (but also kind of the same) <ja>こういち</ja>s attacking and throwing spears at the piceratops. But, because it was able to charge up in the sunlight, it uses its powers to shoot light in all directions, rendering all the <ja>こういち</ja>s momentarily blind, allowing it to escape.		572	-	kanji Lesson_5
同	Kanji	冋, 一	Mustache, Ground	radical, radical	Same	Same		<reading>どう</reading>	おな			どう	おな								There's a <radical>mustache</radical> on the <radical>ground</radical>. Upon closer inspection, you see that the mustache on the ground is exactly the <kanji>same</kanji> as yours!	Pick up the mustache, hold it up next to your face in front of a mirror. It's unbelievable, but it's the same in every way, down to the last hair.	"When we need to remember the reading <ja>どう</ja>, we use the word ""doughnut"".  While this is already strange enough, you notice something stranger. Over a couple feet away is a <reading>dou</reading>ghnut (<ja>どう</ja>) who also has the <kanji>same</kanji> mustache as you (and the one that fell on the ground). The doughnut looks at you for a moment, then scampers off. This doughnut must be a mutant because normally doughnuts don't move."	If it helps, imagine hundreds or thousands of doughnuts all around you with the same exact mustache. First of all, it's terrifying to be surrounded by thousands of mutant doughnuts. Secondly, it's really weird they all have the same mustache as you.		573	-	kanji Lesson_5
回	Kanji	口	Mouth	radical	Times, Revolve	Times, Revolve		<reading>かい</reading>	まわ			かい	まわ								"There's a <radical>mouth</radical> inside a <radical>mouth</radical>. But if you look even closer (not actually, but we're pretending), you can see another mouth inside that mouth... and another one inside of that one! It keeps going and going. Can you count the number of <kanji>times</kanji> there's a mouth inside a mouth? This kanji also means <kanji>revolve</kanji> too. Think of each ""time"" a thing happens, it loops back around and comes back to the beginning, revolving around again another time."	Imagine yourself counting and counting smaller and smaller mouths inside of each other, recording the number of times you can find a mouth inside another mouth. Dig deeper and deeper until it feels ridiculous how small the mouths are getting. Be sure to focus on the counting and the number of times you find one. Now, how many mouths is this times two, because your mouth is like this too.	If you're having a hard time wrapping your head around the infinite number of <kanji>times</kanji> these mouths <kanji>revolve</kanji>, just picture yourself in a little <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>) going around and down through the mouths.	Your kayak is slashing and dipping through the revolving mouths, going down and down more times than you can count!		574	-	kanji Lesson_5
多	Kanji	夕	Evening	radical	Many, Much, Lots Of	Many, Much, Lots Of		<reading>た</reading>	おお			た	おお								How many <radical>evenings</radical> are there? There are <kanji>many</kanji>.	"If you accidentally think ""a lot"" or something similar, that's okay too. It's the basic meaning that counts, and all these things are pretty close, though eventually you want to get to the point where you know that this kanji does in fact mean <kanji>many</kanji>."	"To remember the reading <ja>た</ja> we use the word ""Taco""  Let's start with the kanji meaning: <kanji>many</kanji>. You go outside in the evening (because that's what this kanji is made up of) and are surprised when you're hit by <kanji>many</kanji> <reading>ta</reading>cos flying from the sky. For some reason it's raining tacos, and of course you have no idea why."	The tacos pelt you and knock you off your feet. Hard shell, soft shell, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese... it's terrible. And there are so many of them, flying from the sky to drown you in tacos. This is absolutely absurd (and you should think that too, so you remember the reading).		575	-	kanji Lesson_5
当	Kanji	<i class=radical-triceratops></i>, ヨ	Triceratops, Wolverine	radical, radical	Correct, Right, Success	Correct, Right, Success	Light	<reading>とう</reading>	あ			とう	あ								"There's a <radical>triceratops</radical> and a <radical>wolverine</radical>. What are they doing together? You'd think they'd fight, but they took their battle to another venue... they're competing in a game show! One of them answers a question, and the host says, ""<kanji>Success</kanji>! You're <kanji>correct</kanji>!"""	Feel free to think through several questions and answers, but make sure they're all right, because that's what we're focusing on. Also make sure to focus on the triceratops and the wolverine themselves. You want to make sure that when you see these two radicals you automatically know they're playing in a game show, not doing anything else, like fighting or racing or something.	"When we need to remember the reading <ja>とう</ja>, we use the Japanese city Tokyo. The last question in the game show match is the following: ""What is the capital of Japan."" The triceratops and the wolverine scream the <kanji>correct</kanji> answer at the same time: <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>!"	Wow, that was a pretty easy answer to get right. <ja>とうきょう</ja> is what pretty much everyone would guess, and they'd be correct.		576	-	kanji Lesson_5

What do you think you're going to do with this gun? Of course, you're going to shoot the windows... <kanji>every</kanji> single one of them.	Make a point to make sure you get <kanji>every</kanji> one, and don't miss any of them. Actually search around in your imagination for any more windows, because you want to stress it's important you hit <kanji>every</kanji> one.	Now that <kanji>every</kanji> single window is broken you feel pretty stupid because a bunch of <reading>mi</reading>ce (<ja>まい</ja>) come pouring in through them. You've made a way for them to get into your house. That wasn't smart.	Now you need to shoot every one of the mice that came through those broken windows. You can't let any survive. You have to get every last one out of here!!		577	-	kanji Lesson_5
米	Kanji	米	Rice	radical	Rice, America	Rice, America		<reading>べい</reading> <reading>まい</reading>	こめ			べい, まい	こめ								"The <radical>rice</radical> radical and <kanji>rice</kanji> are the same in looks as well as in meaning. This also refers to ""America,"" maybe because America is covered in rice or fields or something?"	Aren't radicals nice? They make things so much easier... if you've been studying them.	You've got tons of dry grains of <kanji>rice</kanji>. You have no idea what you're going to do with it. Then, you come up with a solution. All this dry rice could go towards filling up the <reading>bay</reading> (<ja>べい</ja>), so you have more land to farm on!	In your mind, bulldoze the rice into the bay, watching it fill it up, then pile high. It's not particularly good looking land, but it'll do, and it's already full of seeds, so that's pretty good. The important thing is that you think you have way too much of the stuff, so the only way to get rid of it is to dump it in a large body of water, and that large body of water is a bay.		578	-	kanji Lesson_5
羽	Kanji	羽	Feathers	radical	Feather, Feathers, Wing, Wings	Feather, Feathers, Wing, Wings		う	<reading>はね</reading> <reading>は</reading> <reading>わ</reading>			はね, は, わ	う								The <radical>feather</radical> radical and <kanji>feather</kanji> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.	Have you been studying your radicals? If so, this'll be easy!	All these <kanji>feather</kanji>s. You're a bird man / woman, and you're getting ready to fly. Just as you're about to take off, someone dumps you with <reading>honey</reading> <ja>はね</ja> and you're all goopy, unable to go anywhere.	Taste the honey, feel it all over your feathers. Go ahead and plummet towards the ground (because you were jumping off a building to fly when someone doused you with honey). At least it's a tasty way to go, no?		579	-	kanji Lesson_5

But, it won't work. You won't listen. So, the man in the coffin just begins to <kanji>think</kanji>: What could I have done better in my life? Why am I in this situation? How will I get out? Think, damnit, think!!	"Imagine him changing from a begging position to a stereotypical ""thinking"" position, hand on chin, eyebrows furrowed. Focus on the beggar's thinking. This is a pretty abstract idea to imagine, so it will be important to create a very vivid picture in your mind's eye."	What is the beggar <kanji>think</kanji>ing of? A thought bubble pops up into existence near his head. In it is a picture of <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>! He's thinking that if <ja>こういち</ja> was here, he'd save him. Oh, if only <ja>こういち</ja> could save us all!	Then, the beggar realizes that he is <ja>こういち</ja>. You're burying <ja>こういち</ja> in a coffin alive and all he can think of is himself.		580	-	kanji Lesson_5
肉	Kanji	肉	Meat	radical	Meat	Meat		<reading>にく</reading>				にく									The <radical>meat</radical> radical and <kanji>meat</kanji> are the same in looks as well as and meaning.	Study those radicals, and perhaps we'll eat some meat tonight.	You know there's people-eating going on here, with this kanji. So, when you think of this <kanji>meat</kanji>, you'll have to think about whose meat it is. In this case, it's <reading>Nick</reading>'s (<ja>にく</ja>) meat.	Do you know someone named <reading>Nick</reading> you can imagine? There's celebrities too, if you don't have someone. Someone like <reading>Nick</reading> Cage would do the trick.		581	-	kanji Lesson_5

"Radicals have self. Kanji has self. Kanji and radicals can sometimes be the same thing... so do they really have ""self""? Only way to find out is to study both of them hard!"	"When we need to remember <ja>じ</ja> we use the word ""Jesus.""  Who said you should always look at your <kanji>self</kanji> before tossing stones (or whatever) at others? <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>) did.

Isn't that nice?	Make sure you know all those radicals, will make your life more pleasant.	People are attacking from the <kanji>West</kanji>, so you pull out your <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) and beat them back. You keep pushing further and further West until you reach the ocean and there's nowhere left for them to run.

何	Kanji	ｲ, 可	Leader, Lip Ring	radical, radical	What	What		か	<reading>なに</reading> <reading>なん</reading>			なに, なん	か								Our <radical>leader</radical> has a <radical>lip ring</radical>. Wait, our leader has a lip ring? <kanji>WHAT</kanji>??	"Think of our president (or your prime minister, or dictator, or whatever) and imagine this person appearing on television one morning with a big ol' lip ring. Feel surprised by it. Just say ""What??"" over and over again. You want to have the feeling of ""what"" in you when you imagine this - that'll help you to remember this kanji's meaning."	"The leader with his lip ring is now eating some <reading>naan</reading> (<ja>なん</ja>) and curry. It's delicious, of course... but then he gets it caught on his lip ring, and tears half his lip off. He screams: ""<reading>Nannnnn eeeeeeeeeehhh</reading>!!"" (<ja>なに</ja>) in anger at the naan and curry."	Make this one vivid and scary. He's eating the naan (that's your <ja>なん</ja>), and then he screams at the naan but gets overwhelmed with pain (that's the <ja>なに</ja>). Smell the naan (you're there) and see the blood gushing out of his/her lip. It's terrifying. How did the naan even catch on his lip ring anyways?		586	-	kanji Lesson_5

Knowing about bodies is a privilege. One that only leaders get—it helps them control all their subjects, like you.	Imagine looking down at your body and thinking, huh, I wonder what all that junk is? Oh well, I'm sure the leader has it all figured out in that book of his.	The leader's <kanji>body</kanji> book also taught him about something very body specific: how to tie a <reading>tie</reading> (<ja>たい</ja>). You can't have a tie on your body, no no. Those are for the leader and his smart body.	Picture the leader, reading a book, putting a tie on his body. Look around at you and your family and your neighbors.

It's sort of like the one ring to rule them all, the one ring to bind them... except with keys.	Imagine the leader taking his key to open up a safe that has a button to make other keys for the underlings. No key is as great as this key, though.	"You <kanji>make</kanji> a key for an underling, and he looks at it disapprovingly (even though you're their leader!). He simply says, ""this key <reading>sucks</reading>"" (<ja>さく</ja>) and then walks off. How could this be?"	Feel angry about this.

This crazy viking child who prefers <kanji>study</kanji> over pillaging (and other viking activities)... the other vikings just stop and <reading>gawk</reading> (<ja>がく</ja>) at him when they walk by.

Think about it. If you give a roof legs, it goes even higher up. What's higher up? The sky is!	The reason you want to put a roof in the <kanji>sky</kanji> is because it gets the roof away from all the <reading>coo</reading>ties (<ja>くう</ja>) that are on the ground.

As in, drops would move out of their normal flight path just to hit you on your head? You'd be a lot wetter, that's for sure.	"Imagine a world where each rain drop had to choose a target to aim for. How strange would rainfall be? Also, <ja>あめ</ja> and ""aim"" don't really sound too much alike, but the goal is to use ""aim"" to get to <ja>あめ</ja>, so make sure to take note of that in your mind as you learn the reading."		606	-	kanji Lesson_5

Flowers can't grow in these conditions.	Think of how disappointed you are. You wanted a beautiful cross of flowers, and now you just have a big overgrown patch of thick grass. It isn't even pretty green grass, it's a little brown and damaged from the sun.	The <kanji>grass</kanji> on top is brown and burned from the sun, so you need to take a <reading>cool saw</reading> (<ja>くさ</ja>) and hack the tops off. The saw is actually physically cool to the touch, to help heal the grass' sunburned bits. It just happens to look cool too.	Imagine using your cool saw to saw off the heads of all of this grass. You made the cross pretty big, so there is a ton of grass to get through. The sun is beating down on you and the grass too, which isn't making it any easier.		608	-	kanji Lesson_5

This kanji is also used as the <kanji>bread loaf counter</kanji>, probably because bread was so big and hard in the past that they had to use axes to slice them.	Imagine you've gone back in time a good hundred years, and you're trying to count loaves of bread after each swing of your axe. Axes and bread loaves will become intertwined in your brain.	You imagined being back in time too good and now you're stuck using an <kanji>axe</kanji> to be a <kanji>bread loaf counter</kanji> for the <reading>Kin</reading>g (<ja>きん</ja>) of England.
