禺	Radical				Splinter	Splinter															Although a little bit modified, there is a turtle shell that's on a mustache with this radical. The only thing with a mustache that hangs around turtles is Splinter, the giant rat from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So this radical is <radical>Splinter</radical> (the giant rat).					7539	-	Lesson_50 radical
<i class=radical-psychopath></i>	Radical				Psychopath	Psychopath															Inside this guy's forehead you have a spoon and a bunch of hair, not to mention whatever that is in the top left. That's the mind of a <radical>psychopath</radical> right there.					7540	-	Lesson_50 radical
峰	Kanji	山, 夆	Mountain, Signpost	radical, radical	Summit	Summit		<reading>ほう</reading>	みね			ほう	みね								At the top of the <radical>mountain</radical> is a <radical>signpost</radical> to tell you you've reached the <kanji>summit</kanji>. Literally every mountain that humans have reached the top of has one of these summit signs.	If that signpost wasn't there how would you know you reached the summit? Like, if you were on top of Everest and there was a bad storm... you'd just topple off the other side. Those summit signposts are important!	At the <kanji>summit</kanji>, you decide to build your new <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>). It's been destroyed so many times, and you're sick of it. Maybe if you build you home at the summit of this mountain it will be safer.	Picture your beautiful summit home. You know, George Washington had one of these too. So. That's cool, I guess.		7541	-	kanji Lesson_50

He doesn't do it for money or fame, he begs for construction because he is so <kanji>adept</kanji> at what he does.	The construction beggar looks like any other beggar, which makes it even stranger that he's so adept at what he does. He really puts everything into his construction work.	"""The most <kanji>adept</kanji> at construction in all the land is me,"" says the construction beggar to emperor <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>."	The construction beggar is giving a presentation on why he would be the best choice for making a grand new palace for Emperor <ja>こういち</ja>. Point number one: he is the most adept at construction.  Hint: When you see <ja>工</ja> in a kanji it will often take the <ja>こう</ja> reading.		7542	-	kanji Lesson_50

Something wicked probably lives in the building too.	Not like, wicked cool, but like wicked evil. I see you, New Englanders.	You peek inside the <kanji>wicked</kanji> building and a wicked <reading>ja</reading>guar (<ja>じゃ</ja>) suddenly pounces at you! You let out a sigh of relief when it's stopped by the window, but then... the window opens?! What a wicked building! It's letting the jaguar get you!	Imagine being chased around the outside of this wicked fanged building as the wicked fanged jaguar tries to eat you. Ahhh!		7543	-	kanji Lesson_50

A fat horse. So burdensome. Not to mention the burden on the horse on top of the fatness.	But you have to be nice to the <kanji>burdensome</kanji> horse because this horse is your <reading>da</reading>d (<ja>だ</ja>).

Believe it or not, this <kanji>sudden</kanji> invention of <kanji>China</kanji> happened in <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. Well, it wasn't <ja>とうきょう</ja> yet.

The <kanji>court</kanji> of the Yoga King is against you. You have to turn this around, so you start pushing <reading>ta</reading>ter (<ja>てい</ja>) tots into his tater-tot-hole shaped mouth.

The tree goes from being a regular tree to being a psychopath. Such mood swings are so rough. Especially when the tree slips to <kanji>gloom</kanji>.	Imagine all the mood swings of this tree. Psychopath tree! Also very gloomy sometimes.	Then the tree switches from <kanji>gloom</kanji> to being super excited (these moodswings!). The super excited tree starts doing dubstep. <reading>Uts</reading> (<ja>うつ</ja>) uts uts uts uts <ja>♬</ja>.	Sing along with the moody tree. Gloom to dubstep.

The bamboo flattens as it hits the ground then turns into papers. The papers combine to become record books that show what happened here, this day.

She's using it to trap water, making this a dirt <kanji>dam</kanji>. If you think about it, dams are just dirt cages anyway.	Picture the woman working tirelessly in the hot sun, moving and shaping the dirt around this river into a dam to make a pond.	Something about the woman working hard to build this <kanji>dam</kanji> makes her super <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>) to you.

Unfortunately, building a correct <kanji>embankment</kanji> doesn't just take dirt, but <reading>ta</reading>ter (<ja>てい</ja>) tots too.

Because, if a wave is big enough, it will curl over on itself, creating a sort of cave within the wave. That's why it's the same as a cave!	Also, imagine a tsunami hitting a cave, becoming the same as the cave (since a cave will shape it).	Best way to remember the reading for this kanji is to think about how the shape of a cave is the shape of a <reading>dou</reading>ghnut (<ja>どう</ja>).
