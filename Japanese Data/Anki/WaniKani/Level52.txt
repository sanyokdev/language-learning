Some people called you crazy, but you'll show them, as you lead an entire crew of leather helicopter pilots on their first mission to space!	Not many people have the leadership it takes to lead such a mission. Imagine what it takes to do it!	"Under your superior <kanji>leadership</kanji> you and your leather helicopter crew are able to make it to the moon. The moon!

When do you miss taking a <kanji>bath</kanji> the most? When you're on the <reading>ro</reading>ad (<ja>ろ</ja>). Traveling is fun and all, but when you're stuck in a car, traveling down a dirt road for days, all you want to do is take a nice long bath.	Imagine being stuck on the road all day for a week.

As you <kanji>embrace</kanji> the sad turkey it makes a funny sound and suddenly starts pooping <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>) all over you. But you don't want to stop embracing it! It's probably just scared still. But the more you squeeze, the faster the yogurt comes out of it!	Imagine embracing the turkey as it covers you in yogurt poo. You hope it's yogurt at least.

The <kanji>orphan</kanji> melon boy is but a <ja><reading>子</reading></ja> (<ja>こ</ja>).	"That's the sad thing about the melon orphan boy... he's just a child.

The clown did you some favors, and everyone knows clowns only accept shellfish as a form of currency. So your compensation is a pile of random shellfish.	Picture the shellfish in your hands.

"Once the clown has been properly <kanji>compensate</kanji>d, he looks you in the eyes, one hand full of shellfish, the other in the air, and waves, ""<reading>Bye</reading> (<ja>ばい</ja>)"" he says.

They link their triceratops horns together and form an unbreakable gold chain. You can't eat them, because they're gold. So they're only really good for their chaining together ability.	Picture these little gold triceratops shellfish linked together by their horns in a chain around your neck. Feel them hanging there. Sparkly and cold.	However, the only way to break the <kanji>chain</kanji> is to <reading>saw</reading> (<ja>さ</ja>) it open. Once the triceratops shellfish start holding on, they never let go. So when you want to take the chain off you have to really hack at it with your saw.	Picture the saw in your hands, sawing back and forth on the gold chain around your neck. Maybe this isn't the best fashion accessory if you have to use a saw to get it off.		7789	-	kanji Lesson_52

Perhaps you're laying on your back, and they burst out of your mouth.	When do inanimate objects <kanji>erupt</kanji> from your mouth? Mostly when you're having <reading>fun</reading> (<ja>ふん</ja>).	It's really inconvenient that things erupt from your mouth whenever you're having fun. Makes it hard to have fun.		7790	-	kanji Lesson_52

Lights shine out of it and the whole world weeps at its beauty. Look at the sheep's fluffy glowing head. Nothing could be more auspicious and glorious than this.	Picture this auspicious spirit sheep. Blessing the children with its fluffy hooves.	The spirit sheep is so <kanji>auspicious</kanji> that the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) declares this day to be the most auspicious of all days. The day when the spirit sheep appeared.	Picture the Shougun telling the world that they must fly spirit sheep flags on this day forever, because of how auspicious it is.		7791	-	kanji Lesson_52

In the old days, cows' lives were given to the gods as offerings pretty often.	Picture yourself offering the cow's life up to the god(s). It's a good thing we don't actually have to do this anymore, you think.	You prepare the <kanji>offering</kanji> with your holy blue <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>). Normally this would be gruesome, but your saber glows and the cow's life shoots up into the sky without you laying a hand on it.	Thanks to the mercy of your saber, the offering is quick and painless. A normal saber, however, would have cut that cow to bits. Like, really just wrecked it. Good thing we didn't make you think about that, huh?		7792	-	kanji Lesson_52
秩	Kanji	禾, 失	Grain, Fault	radical, radical	Order, Regularity	Order, Regularity		<reading>ちつ</reading>				ちつ									If a <radical>grain</radical> has a <radical>fault</radical>, it needs to be put back in <kanji>order</kanji>. Grains must be perfectly identical at all times, otherwise they'll be thrown out. That's why special people will go out and check them to confirm their <kanji>regularity</kanji>. Keeping order is a tough job!	Imagine being one of these people who maintain order by going out in the fields and inspecting every single grain, keeping the good ones and plucking off the ones with faults.	You can always tell if a company keeps <kanji>order</kanji> or if it <reading>cheats</reading> (<ja>ちつ</ja>) just by looking at the grains.	If there are faulty grains in there, they cheated and order was not maintained. Now you have to go through all the grains and throw out the weird ones yourself.		7793	-	kanji Lesson_52

Mostly because the spider in your mouth makes you grumpy, but also because the spider keeps telling you to be an instigator with its little mouth inside your own mouth.	Imagine having a spider in your mouth. Imagine being angry about it and instigating fights between people because of it.	The spider in your mouth tells you to <kanji>instigate</kanji> a fight by <reading>saw</reading>ing (<ja>さ</ja>) the other person's leg off. It even whispers where you can find a nice big saw.

The more you play and the longer it's under the moon, the larger your hair will swell.	Have you been suffering from flat, boring hair? Well do I have the swelling treatment you've been looking for!	Using this method, your hair <kanji>swell</kanji>s so much it looks like a giant <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) ball is sitting on top of your head. It's all round, and well... swollen is probably the only word that fits.	Imagine watching your hair swell to the size of a large bowling ball.

The best way to get perfume out of flowers is to make them face the same way. Then the smell will go the same direction, making you smell great.	Imagine aiming a bunch of flowers in the same direction towards you. The perfume coats your body. You smell great now!	You decide to <kanji>perfume</kanji> your entire <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>) by planting flowers all the way around it, all facing in toward it.

Also <kanji>constant</kanji> is the Emperor <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>, who will surely rule for a thousand more years!	A constant rule from Emperor <ja>こういち</ja> means constant kanji learning and constant WaniKani reviews. They will always be constant!		7797	-	kanji Lesson_52

It is also <kanji>necessary</kanji> that you wear a <reading>su</reading>it (<ja>す</ja>) when eating shaved geoduck. It's a super fancy meal so a suit is necessary for you to enjoy it correctly.

You decide to give in to his <kanji>biased</kanji> recommendations and look at what he has in his library. It doesn't take long until you realize that these books are all about <reading>hen</reading>s (<ja>へん</ja>) and hen care.
