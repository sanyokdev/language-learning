They must have been <kanji>set aside</kanji> by their previous owners. They definitely weren't cut off or anything, someone just decided they didn't want them anymore and set them aside.	What would have to happen for you to set aside your own fingers? Try to imagine it right now.	I know why they <kanji>set aside</kanji> their fingers long ago, it's because there was no <reading>so</reading>ap (<ja>そ</ja>). If you didn't have soap to clean your fingers you wouldn't want to keep them for very long...	Think of all the things you do with your fingers. Now picture how they would look if you had never ever cleaned them with soap. Uhg, disgusting. You should just set them aside here, and find some new ones.		6263	-	kanji Lesson_41

The cold winter weathers cover the table in frost, and when you wipe it away, you can see traces of what the table was originally based on. All tables have to be based on something, even if it's just other tables that came before them.	Imagine tracing your fingers over the table, the cold winter frost stinging them, as you reveal the secrets of this table and what it was based on.	This particular table was <kanji>based on</kanji> Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょ</ja>). Little buildings and temples, that sort of look like Little Kyoto. Problem is, it was made by a <reading><ja>子</ja></reading> (<ja>こ</ja>), so it's not very good.	The buildings and temples are all very childlike. Like crayon drawn on a table.		6264	-	kanji Lesson_41

Why? Because it's a very pure ceremony, and only those with an extremely righteous mind can run it.	Have him run your ceremony for you. Think about why he is so righteous, then think about an extremely righteous ceremony.	Sadly, the reason only the righteous can run this <kanji>ceremony</kanji> is because it's a punishment ceremony, where he pulls the cord to cut someone's head off via a <reading>gui</reading>llotine (<ja>ぎ</ja>).	*CHOP*		6265	-	kanji Lesson_41

If you're still not sure if the tree is really made of <kanji>wood</kanji>, just take out a small <reading>ju</reading>ice (<ja>じゅ</ja>) box and start drinking it. A wooden tree will show no interest in the juice box at all.	"However! A non-wood tree will be really thirsty from pretending to be a wood tree.

You reach into the trash, take out the <kanji>abandon</kanji>ed fruit, and bite into it. OUCH! There's a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) inside, and you just bit into it.

You know, a tiger has the legs of a tiger. This is common knowledge. Nothing new here.	Look at the tiger running with his tiger legs. So majestic. So fierce.	The <kanji>tiger</kanji> is using his legs to run away from the <reading>Torah</reading> (<ja>とら</ja>). This tiger is deathly afraid of religion, so a holy book like the Torah causes the tiger to run away.	Imagine watching the tiger as it notices the Torah and then runs away.

In the insect kingdom, the insect most resembling a Viking is undoubtedly the firefly.	Imagine this little firefly blinking his firefly light as he flies around shouting a Viking warcry and brandishing an axe. Yaaaargh!	The Viking <kanji>firefly</kanji> is attacking <reading>Hotaru</reading> (<ja>ほたる</ja>) Tomoe (alter ego of Sailor Saturn) because the Viking firefly hates the show Sailor Moon and everyone on it.

Sake is very important to the alcohol culture in Japan, so you must make sure to measure it out to the precise amount.	Imagine this sake as you measure it out.

Bees are a certain insect that build a roof around their honey.	To get the <kanji>honey</kanji> out, you need to put on special <reading>mitts</reading> (<ja>みつ</ja>) so your hands don't get stung.	Your thick mitts make it so the bees can't even sting your hands. Unfortunately, you are naked and only wearing mitts, what were you thinking?		6272	-	kanji Lesson_41

You keep digging until you realize that these are a part of some big <kanji>ruins</kanji>. They're the ruins of tiger and cactus statues. It looks like whoever used to live here worshiped tigers and cacti. Or maybe they ate them. But now their whole civilization is just ruins.	Imagine looking through these ruins. Picture the broken tiger and cactus statues. Try to imagine the people who used to live here before it turned to ruins.	Well, as it turns out, these are the <kanji>ruins</kanji> of Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょ</ja>), the city that existed before the modern day one.

The two husbands run a centaur farm, but the local government isn’t too pleased by this so they have to conceal their centaurs in the sun unless they want them to be confiscated by the government.	Imagine the tsunami carrying the husbands and the centaur up into the sun. Hear the water gushing as they conceal the centaur up there. That tsunami is gigantic.	What is it the husbands are going to <kanji>conceal</kanji>? Oh that’s right, a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<ja>せん</ja>). They are concealing a centaur in the sun. How forgetful of you.

You can make fire with the charcoal, but you were hoping to find fire itself. All that climbing for nothing.	You’re angry that you could only find charcoal so you take the charcoal in your hands and you crush it atop the cliff on the mountain. Feel the charcoal breaking in your hands as the wind carries the charcoal dust off from the top of the cliff on the mountain.	After crushing the <kanji>charcoal</kanji>, you decide to take advantage of your current location and lay out in the sun for a while to get a <reading>tan</reading> (<ja>たん</ja>).

Your rice paddy farm and <kanji>field</kanji> are on a cay. A cay is a small, sandy island, and since your farm is on fire, this cay has turned into a hot cay.

The fire is ravaging the entire hot cay, so it takes you a while to put it out. Man those flames are hot.  Also, this kanji can have the reading <ja>はた</ja> for the kun'yomi as well.
