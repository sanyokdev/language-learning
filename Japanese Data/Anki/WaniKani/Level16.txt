面	Radical				Face	Face, Robot															You have a leaf, a mouth, and an eye. Those are all things you'll find on a <radical>face</radical>! Wait, you don't have a leaf growing out of your face? Huh... well just imagine you have a normal human face with a leaf on there somewhere, ya weirdo.					2450	-	Lesson_16 radical
壴	Radical				Drum	Drum															This radical is made up of samurai and beans. Samurai used to put beans in <radical>drum</radical>s so they could tap and shake them to make noise. Can you imagine shaking and tapping this drum radical?					2451	-	Lesson_16 radical
<i class=radical-zombie></i>	Radical				Zombie	Zombie															This radical has a figure reaching out both hands at you with some dirt on his head. This is a <radical>zombie</radical>, and he must have just recently dug himself out of the grave by the looks of it.					2452	-	Lesson_16 radical
園	Kanji	口, <i class=radical-zombie></i>	Mouth, Zombie	radical, radical	Garden, Park	Garden, Park		<reading>えん</reading>	その			えん	その								You examine the <radical>mouth</radical> of a <radical>zombie</radical> and find a small <kanji>garden</kanji> in there. There are even benches... it looks like a <kanji>park</kanji>.	Zombies are dead, so I guess their mouths have all the things garden plants crave. Their mouths are like compost piles, if you think about it.	You look closer at the <kanji>garden</kanji> and suddenly everything <reading>en</reading>ds (<ja>えん</ja>).	Oh. The zombie probably bit down on your head and now it's the end for you. At least you were looking at a nice garden at the end of it all...		2453	-	kanji Lesson_16
曜	Kanji	日, ヨ, 隹	Sun, Wolverine, Turkey	radical, radical, radical	Weekday, Day Of The Week	Weekday, Day Of The Week		<reading>よう</reading>				よう									As the <radical>sun</radical> rises over the hills, the ferocious <radical>wolverine</radical> stalks a <radical>turkey</radical> on a <kanji>weekday</kanji> morning. The wolverine hunts turkeys for a living, but on the weekends, he likes to play racquetball at the local gym. That’s why the turkey is getting hunted on a weekday.	You’ve probably seen those nature shows like on National Geographic. Think back to one of those shows where the hunter stalks its prey and leaps out in slow motion to do the murder. Now imagine this scene with the wolverine leaping out at the turkey. The wolverine howls a bloodcurdling shriek as the turkey lurches in agony, feathers flying everywhere as the wolverine sinks its teeth into flesh.	This wolverine has a strange palate, however. It likes to turn its turkey into turkey <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>). After the hunt every <kanji>weekday</kanji>, the wolverine spends the evening turning the turkey meat into a strange, thick and chunky, turkey yogurt.	Imagine eating this turkey yogurt. It tastes pretty much exactly how you would expect. Chunks of turkey meat mixed with thick and creamy yogurt. It tastes like mushy Thanksgiving. Imagine eating this every day of the week.		2454	-	kanji Lesson_16
書	Kanji	聿, 日	Brush, Sun	radical, radical	Write, Writing	Write, Writing		<reading>しょ</reading>	か			しょ	か								Why would you try to take a <radical>brush</radical> to the <radical>sun</radical>? It's almost too obvious, because you want to <kanji>write</kanji> something down.	Just imagine yourself sitting on the sun, writing back to your friends and family with a brush. For someone who can visit the sun, it's really weird that you are writing with a brush like this, but you're doing it just the same.	What did you <kanji>write</kanji> about? You were writing about this amazing circus <reading>show</reading> (<ja>しょ</ja>)you just watched on the sun. You didn't expect there to be any shows here, but turns out you were wrong!	Think of your favorite live shows and imagine them on the sun. Also imagine yourself writing back to your friends and family about said shows.		2455	-	kanji Lesson_16
遠	Kanji	⻌, <i class=radical-zombie></i>	Scooter, Zombie	radical, radical	Far	Far		<reading>えん</reading>	とお			えん	とお								You see a <radical>scooter</radical> with a <radical>zombie</radical> on it, going really <kanji>far</kanji> away. Someone tied that zombie to the scooter and now it's far off in the distance, groaning and growling.	Picture the zombie, going far off into the distance. It's getting smaller and harder to see.	The zombie goes so <kanji>far</kanji>, that its life <reading>en</reading>ds (<ja>えん</ja>). Zombies need to eat to live (it's really all they need), but they go so far on their scooter trip, that they just give up and end it all.	I mean, to be fair, the zombie wasn't really alive to begin with. But going far enough to end it all? That's some serious distance!		2456	-	kanji Lesson_16
門	Kanji	門	Gate	radical	Gates, Gate	Gates, Gate		<reading>もん</reading>				もん									The radical for <radical>gate</radical> and the kanji for <kanji>gates</kanji> are the same!	Know your radicals or you won't be allowed to pass.	You're standing in front of some <kanji>gates</kanji>. You can't get through them, but on the other side you hear all kinds of loud <reading>moan</reading>s (<ja>もん</ja>). Are those zombie noises? Is this gate to keep the zombies out, or in?	They start pounding on the gate, and it begins to budge. Focus in on their moaning noises, because that's the reading of this kanji, but also feel the fear as well. When you start moaning too, it seems to calm them. Go ahead and pretend you're in front of this gate, and moan out loud for me a bit. Uwhhhhhh. Muhehwhhhhhhh.		2457	-	kanji Lesson_16
係	Kanji	ｲ, 一, 糸	Leader, Ground, Thread	radical, radical, radical	Connection	Connection		<reading>けい</reading>	かか かかり			けい	かか, かかり								A psychic <radical>leader</radical> can pick a <radical>thread</radical> up off the <radical>ground</radical> and make a <kanji>connection</kanji> with the person that it came from. This leader is very powerful, so even a thread is enough for them to make a psychic connection with the person who was wearing the thread.	Imagine you are this leader and you just picked up this piece of thread from the ground. You get a jarring psychic connection with the owner of the thread. Your head spins, your heart races, and your hands tremble. Picture this happening to you as you pick up the thread from the ground.	As you develop this psychic <kanji>connection</kanji> with the owner of the thread, you can tell that he is currently eating a <reading>ca</reading>ke (<ja>けい</ja>). Since the connection is so strong, you feel like you are eating the cake as well. It’s vanilla strawberry.	Because the connection is so strong, you feel like you too are eating the cake. You taste the fluffy and creamy vanilla strawberry flavors washing over your tongue. Imagine yourself eating this delectable cake. It’s fantastically delicious.		2458	-	kanji Lesson_16
取	Kanji	耳, 又	Ear, Stool	radical, radical	Take	Take		<reading>しゅ</reading>	と			しゅ	と								There's an <radical>ear</radical> just sitting on a <radical>stool</radical>. Nobody's watching, so, you <kanji>take</kanji> it.	Feel the rush of stealing something (even though it's a weird something, admittedly). Start walking away quickly. You don't want to get caught!	To make sure you get away after taking something that doesn't belong to you, you jump into a laundry <reading>chute</reading> (<ja>しゅ</ja>)! You saw other criminals take things and jump down chutes, so you decide to do it too.	Feel the ear you took in your hands as you fly down the chute, the wind whipping past your own ears as you slide to freedom!		2459	-	kanji Lesson_16
品	Kanji	品	Products	radical	Product, Article, Goods, Products	Product, Article, Goods, Products		<reading>ひん</reading>	しな			ひん	しな								The <radical>products</radical> radical and the <kanji>product</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Productive!		As you try to sell these <kanji>product</kanji>s, you finally get a buyer. It's a <reading>Hin</reading>du (<ja>ひん</ja>) person. She walks in and buys your products on the spot!	"Then another Hindu person walks in your store and buys some. Then another... What are all these Hindu people doing buying your products, you wonder? When you ask them, they tell you ""it's a cultural thing."""		2460	-	kanji Lesson_16
守	Kanji	宀, 寸	Roof, Measurement	radical, radical	Protect	Protect		<reading>す</reading> <reading>しゅ</reading>	まも もり			す, しゅ	まも, もり								Your <radical>roof</radical> needs <radical>measurement</radical>s done every year to make sure it will <kanji>protect</kanji> you properly.	If you think about it, your roof protects you from a lot of things! Rain, snow, bird poop. But if your roof's measurements are off it won't be able to protect you properly.	If the measurements are off, and your roof doesn't <kanji>protect</kanji> you, then you get to <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>す</ja>)! If you're still alive, that is.	Odds are, the roof collapsed or a tree fell on you and you died from lack of protection. So now your family and friends are going to sue on your behalf.		2461	-	kanji Lesson_16
幸	Kanji	亠, 辛	Lid, Spicy	radical, radical	Happiness	Happiness		<reading>こう</reading>	しあわ さいわ さち			こう	しあわ, さいわ, さち								Put a <radical>lid</radical> on something <radical>spicy</radical> and you'll cook up pure <kanji>happiness</kanji>.	Spicy foods literally do trigger happy chemicals in your brain. It wouldn't be too far off to say that putting a lid on a pot filled with something spicy could produce happiness.	Out of spicy foods you made pure <kanji>happiness</kanji>. You give it to your sad friend <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>, who waits at the table.	<ja>こういち</ja> looks sad. But when you serve him happiness, he starts to perk up a bit. A couple more bites of happiness, and there's a smile on his face. Although when you found <ja>こういち</ja> he was depressed, down on his luck, and hiding from the government, cooking him some spicy foods seems to have brought him some happiness.		2462	-	kanji Lesson_16
急	Kanji	勹, ヨ, 心	Prison, Wolverine, Heart	radical, radical, radical	Hurry	Hurry		<reading>きゅう</reading>	いそ			きゅう	いそ								A <radical>wolverine</radical>'s <radical>heart</radical> is in <radical>prison</radical>, so you need to <kanji>hurry</kanji> to set it free. If you don't hurry, its heart won't survive. And the wolverine's death will be on you.	Imagine a dying wolverine, its heart trapped in a prison. Hurry, save it! You aren't going fast enough! Hurry, hurry!	You're trying to <kanji>hurry</kanji> as fast as you can to save the wolverine. But you're losing strength, so you grab a <reading>cu</reading>cumber (<ja>きゅう</ja>) from your bag and munch on it to get some of your hurrying power back.	Cucumbers help you hurry to where you need to go. Something about the smell, crunch, and taste helps you hurry it up.		2463	-	kanji Lesson_16
真	Kanji	<i class=radical-pope></i>, 一, ハ	Pope, Ground, Fins	radical, radical, radical	Reality	Reality		<reading>しん</reading>	ま			しん	ま								If the <radical>pope</radical> spends all day staring at <radical>fins</radical> on the <radical>ground</radical>, he’s going to lose touch with <kanji>reality</kanji>. He should be focusing on his popish duties, but instead he’s looking at the fish fins he dropped, and now can’t eat because they’re dirty. Silly pope. You can’t let this one thing get you down. You have other things to do.	Picture trying to get the pope to stop staring at the fins laying on the dirty ground. His eyes are all big. Yup, he’s completely lost touch with reality, you think.	You’re doing your best to bring the pope back to <kanji>reality</kanji> when he snaps and kicks you in the <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>). Oww! What the heck, pope! But he’s already back staring at the fins and your shin is throbbing where he kicked.	Imagine the pope angrily kicking your shin super hard. You fall over and pull it close. Feel how badly it aches. Who knew you’d need shin guards to deal with a pope that’s lost touch with reality just from dropping his dinner.		2464	-	kanji Lesson_16
箱	Kanji	竹, 木, 目	Bamboo, Tree, Eye	radical, radical, radical	Box	Box			<reading>はこ</reading>			はこ									Having a keen <radical>eye</radical> for woodworking, you can tell that the <radical>bamboo</radical> from that <radical>tree</radical> over there will make an excellent <kanji>box</kanji>. Boxes made from bamboo trees are very sturdy and fashionable. You have an eye for fashion as well, you see.	At some point in school, you most likely had some sort of woodshop class to take. Remember back to those times and imagine yourself crafting a bamboo box out of a bamboo tree you felled yourself. Don’t forget to wear eye protection though! Wouldn’t want anything to happen to those valuable eyes of yours.	While working on your wooden <kanji>box</kanji> you hear a strange cry from above. You look up and see an angry <reading>hawk</reading> (<ja>はこ</ja>) flying overhead. Oh no! That bamboo you cut down must have been where the hawk lived. Imagine finishing up the box, climbing up some bamboo and tying the box securely up there as a replacement home for the hawk.	Picture the hawk landing in the box and grumpily trying to stuff it full of straw and twigs. At least your beautiful box will be put to good use.		2465	-	kanji Lesson_16

He is so powerful, respected, and feared that people always carry his luggage for him wherever he goes. You might not think a leader of a gang called the Flowers would be intimidating, but he is.	Picture this lip ring wearing gang leader. He’s clad in studded leather and has a big flower embroidered onto the back of his jacket. It’s a big thorny rose. Imagine him in your head, hear the sound of his leather outfit as he strides along unencumbered by luggage.	Remember that giant thorny rose on the lip ring wearing leader’s back? The thorns coming out of it are real, and they’re as sharp as <reading>nee</reading>dles (<ja>に</ja>). You wouldn’t want to prick your finger on them. They’re super pointy and he uses them to defend his <kanji>luggage</kanji>.	Imagine how much it hurts to get pricked by a needle, especially on your finger. Picture this happening to you now. Not comfortable, is it?		2466	-	kanji Lesson_16

But this isn't just a face like the one you're looking at your computer/phone with. It's the <kanji>surface</kanji> kind of face too!	The next time you look at your face, also notice how much surface area it has.	This <kanji>face</kanji> you're looking at, that has a lot of <kanji>surface</kanji> area, belongs to <reading>men</reading> (<ja>めん</ja>). Not a single man, but all men put together. It's hundreds of thousands of men's faces in a row.	Look at the face of all men put together. Measure how much surface area they all take up.		2467	-	kanji Lesson_16
典	Kanji	曲, ハ	Music, Fins	radical, radical	Rule	Rule		<reading>てん</reading>				てん									If you play <radical>music</radical> with your <radical>fins</radical>, one <kanji>rule</kanji> is that you must be a fish. You can’t play music using fish fins that don’t belong to you. That’s the rule. And it’s also rude.	Imagine a fish playing music using his fins. What kind of a song is it? Imagine it in your head as you see a sign with the fish fin rule on it.	There’s also a <kanji>rule</kanji> in place to limit the amount of fish fin musicians. No more than <reading>ten</reading> (<ja>てん</ja>) are allowed to gather and play their music together. That’s the rule. No more than ten.	Picture a group of ten (as per the rule) fish playing music with their fins. Now the song can be louder and more intricate. Imagine it playing in your head.		2468	-	kanji Lesson_16

They loom over you all and try to keep you all organized and together under their control.	Picture a map of the world with actual canopies attached to each government, representing the ruling governments of each place.	Try to get out from under this <kanji>government</kanji> canopy and you'll be labeled a <reading>foo</reading>l (<ja>ふ</ja>). Unless... you can fool them!	Think of all the people who've been labeled as fools by the government because they try to detach themselves from under their reach. It's a pretty long list...		2469	-	kanji Lesson_16

Oh, and whoever cures and heals the most people will be able to <kanji>rule</kanji> over them once everything starts going back to normal. So keep that in mind, kay?	Imagine if you had your own machine to cure yourself if a tsunami came to where you live. It would be pretty convenient!	Alternative ways to <kanji>cure</kanji> yourself after a tsunami are either praying to <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>) or eating your weight in <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>). I'm not sure if I have enough cheese for all the people that got hit though... Hmm, do you have cheese?  Before you make your decision, remember that whoever cures you will be able to <kanji>reign</kanji> over you and your people. So do you want to be led by Jesus or by some cheese? The choice is yours.	Imagine getting Jesus to cure half the people and feeding the other half lots of cheese and their wounds miraculously healing on their own! You're a hero!		2470	-	kanji Lesson_16

Lucky for you, you're a giant, so you just lay down in the valley and use it to <kanji>bathe</kanji>.	Sure, there's a lot of water in the valley, but you're big too. It's the perfect place for you to bathe... and good thing too, you're getting smelly.	You know what would make the <kanji>bath</kanji>ing experience even better? If you had some egg <reading>yolk</reading>s (<ja>よく</ja>) to eat. Just crack those yolks into the water you bathe in, and it'll cook to perfection. Yum!	Imagine cooking egg yolks in the same water you bathe in.		2471	-	kanji Lesson_16

Bamboo is a very jolly plant, and they love to laugh. Even after death in bamboo heaven, the bamboo continue to laugh joyfully. Bamboo heaven is truly a place of laughter.	Imagine yourself as a bamboo plant that laughs in heaven. What are you laughing about? Chuckle to yourself as you remember this kanji.	There’s actually a war a goin’ on up in that there bamboo heaven, y’know? Ye might not have heard of it with all that there <kanji>laugh</kanji>in’ a goin’ on, but there definitely be a <reading>war a</reading> (<ja>わら</ja>) goin’ on up in bamboo heaven, y’hear? The bamboo are scared so that’s why they be laughin’ so much. They nervous.

You’ve been eating them for three hours now and the spiciness from the peppers is really burning your tongue. Throw in the towel, it’s time to quit the contest.  This kanji has another meaning too:  Eating isn't the only thing that makes your <radical>tongue</radical> <radical>spicy</radical>, so do certain <kanji>word</kanji>s. Say your favorite words out loud right now. Feel them on your tongue. Words are the spicy food of language!	You may have to quit eating but you never have to quit saying words. Especially if you're, well, trying to learn a whole new language full of them.	Oh, you're probably wondering who won that spicy food contest after you <kanji>quit</kanji> and became obsessed with <kanji>word</kanji>s instead. It was <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>). Who did you expect? He was great with words AND never quitting when things got spicy.	Picture Jesus scarfing down jalapeño peppers. He never quits. And then he says some words about how the jalapeños gave up their lives for this contest, so we better appreciate them. Thanks Jesus!		2473	-	kanji Lesson_16

These horns are <kanji>related</kanji> and <kanji>connected</kanji> to heaven in some way.	Perhaps they are related to heaven because the devil has horns? Perhaps they are connected to heaven because these are the horns of heaven's enemies? The real reason they're connected will be revealed in the reading mnemonic.	They are <kanji>related</kanji> and <kanji>connected</kanji> to heaven because these are the horns that Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) made from his enemies. God said he could come into heaven if he made a gate of horns, so that's what he did.	Imagine Genghis Khan taking horns off his enemies, and making a gate to heaven.

Whether they actually use these dialects with you is another story. But when they're alone, or with other people who are from the same place, their speech will be different.	Can you even imagine twenty different dialects in your head? Well I can tell you that there are definitely at least twenty of them in Japan alone.	The best way to learn someone's <kanji>dialect</kanji> is to buy them a <reading>ben</reading>to (<ja>べん</ja>) from where they're from. Not only do these bento have writing in their dialect on them, but their speech will immediately shift to match. Then you'll be able to hear how they sound in their head and in private!

Everyone involved in <kanji>politics</kanji> and <kanji>government</kanji> wields a special <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>).

You're running out of steam and you're afraid you might not be able to <kanji>detain</kanji> all of these guys when <reading>Ryu</reading> (<ja>りゅう</ja>) from Street Fighter appears. He hates swords, and will only use fists because it's the honorable way to fight, so he starts helping you detain them!  He's also found a <reading>loo</reading>phole (<ja>る</ja>) in the system and you don't have to be super gentle with these guys either. So detain them as forcefully as you want.

One squid got stuck in his own building, but no one could save him because going in would be too risky. Poor little squid.	"""It's too <kanji>risky</kanji>, leave me!"" the squid cries.
