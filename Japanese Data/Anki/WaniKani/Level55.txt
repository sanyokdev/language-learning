伏	Kanji	ｲ, 犬	Leader, Dog	radical, radical	Bow, Lay	Bow, Lay		<reading>ふく</reading>	ふ			ふく	ふ								When you meet the <radical>leader</radical> <radical>dog</radical> you have to <kanji>bow</kanji> to show your respect. Dogs are pretty great, so the leader of all dogs must be the greatest! You should bow really deeply to this one.	Picture yourself bowing to the leader dog. Leader dog is so cool!	"You <kanji>bow</kanji> as low as you can, but you lose your balance and fall over. ""<reading>F**k</reading> you (<ja>ふく</ja>)!"" the leader dog barks. Oh no. You messed up and now the leader dog is super mad. Saying f**k you is a little harsh for falling over though, you think."	Bow even deeper as the dog leader keeps barking what sounds like f**k you. You're pretty sure that's what he's saying at least... but maybe... maybe it's not.		8205	-	kanji Lesson_55
鎮	Kanji	金, 真	Gold, Reality	radical, radical	Tranquilize	Tranquilize		<reading>ちん</reading>	おさえ しず			ちん	おさえ, しず								The <radical>reality</radical> of <radical>gold</radical> is that it has the power to <kanji>tranquilize</kanji> anyone who gets their hands on it. Gold may seem cool to have in movies and songs, but in reality, it has the power to mess you up!	Imagine being tranquilized by the sweet caress of gold coins. You can't even move. You're in a daze or something.	You've been <kanji>tranquilize</kanji>d and now drool is running down your <reading>chin</reading> (<ja>ちん</ja>). It's actually really gross. But you don't care, look at all this gold! No one will care about your chin when you're rich!	If you let gold tranquilize you, you'll drool all over your own chin. Maybe the chins of other people too, who knows?		8206	-	kanji Lesson_55

You can't plant flowers or vegetables, it's too dry. You can't play outside, your skin will flake. So you need to dedicate yourself to something inside.	You know how you get. When you can't go outside, you dedicate yourself full force into something else. I mean, you made it to level 55, right? That's some serious dedication. And it probably started because of one particularly dry spring.	You decide to <kanji>dedicate</kanji> yourself to your <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>). You don't want to be outside in the dry spring air, so you focus on home activities. You can clean the kitchen, build a shelf, or dedicate your time to your home internet system.	Dedicate yourself to doing things in your home! Haha, who are we kidding, you already did that.  We love you, nerd. ♡		8207	-	kanji Lesson_55
憂	Kanji	百, 冖, 心, 夂	Hundred, Forehead, Heart, Winter	radical, radical, radical, radical	Grief	Grief		<reading>ゆう</reading>	う うれ			ゆう	う, うれ								A <radical>hundred</radical> <radical>forehead</radical>s lower themselves to their <radical>heart</radical>s in <radical>winter</radical> in <kanji>grief</kanji>. There were once many of their kind, the forehead peoples, but now there are only a hundred left after this harsh winter took the rest of them. Their grief is immense.	Imagine if winter was so brutal that there were only one hundred human foreheads left. You lost all of your friends and family. Feel that grief.	Their <kanji>grief</kanji> intensifies because all of the foreheads they lost belonged to <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>). Dead youths everywhere. Now there's no one left to repopulate the world.	Grief for youths is so painful. No one should have to bury their forehead child.		8208	-	kanji Lesson_55
朴	Kanji	木, ト	Tree, Toe	radical, radical	Simple, Crude	Simple, Crude		<reading>ぼく</reading>	えのき ほう ほお			ぼく	えのき, ほう, ほお								You decide to carve a <radical>tree</radical> into a giant replica of your big <radical>toe</radical> because you think it will be really <kanji>simple</kanji>. Once you're done though, it looks like a really <kanji>crude</kanji> attempt at a fat, lumpy blob. Maybe carving isn't as simple as you thought.	Imagine carving a really simple, crude toe from a tree. It's your first attempt, so I guess you should have known it wouldn't be great.	"You're admiring your <kanji>simple</kanji> looking toe tree when a lumberjack runs up and asks who created it. <ja><reading>ぼく</reading></ja>, you say. As in ""I"" said it, in a manly dude, way. He doesn't seem to believe you, so you say it a few more times. <ja>ぼく</ja> <ja>ぼく</ja> <ja>ぼく</ja>!"	Who carved this simple toe? <ja>ぼく</ja>!		8209	-	kanji Lesson_55

These trees are rare, only grow on cliffs, and they always have exactly ten thousand horse chestnuts on each one. 	Picture this tree, weighed down by it's own horse chestnuts, leaning over the edge of the cliff.	You decide to take a bite of a <kanji>horse chestnut</kanji> because it looks yummy, and there are ten thousand, so it's not like anyone will notice. You crack it open and take a nice big bite to find out that it tastes like <reading>toe chee</reading>se (<ja>とち</ja>)! UHG! It's the worst thing you've ever tasted. Like hot, moldy toe cheese! Ewwww! 	Horse chestnuts taste like nasty toe cheese. Imagine what having one in your mouth would be like. 		8210	-	kanji Lesson_55

Thank you soul, for being frugal so that I can have so much now.	You know what being <kanji>frugal</kanji> is? <reading>Sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>). You save money, you use less resources, that's the sexiest thing I can think of.	If you want your spouse or S.O. to think you're more sexy, just be more frugal. They'll definitely appreciate it and see you in a different light.		8211	-	kanji Lesson_55

You don't think dirt is so great? Well what if I took the dirt you own away from you? Your house is on that dirt. It's mine now. Get outta here.	Imagine being so excellent at leading, that you get double the dirt that everyone else gets.	This <kanji>excellent</kanji> leader is going to use all this dirt to store her excellent <reading>ca</reading>rs (<ja>か</ja>)! Excellent people have to have cars in equal or greater than excellent-ness than themselves.	Imagine your own car. Is it as excellent as you?		8212	-	kanji Lesson_55

You <kanji>grieve</kanji> and <kanji>mourn</kanji> for your now-dead toe.	Look at your toe. It has no soul. It's dark and shriveled, like a mummy's toe. Grieve and watch your tears drip onto it.	You decide to <kanji>grieve</kanji> in <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. Your toe always wanted to walk in <ja>とうきょう</ja>, and now you can at least fulfill its dying wish.	Walk through the streets of <ja>とうきょう</ja> grieving, with your dead toe flopping onto the pavement.		8213	-	kanji Lesson_55

The above is what you want them to see! So slice what you say!	Imagine actually slicing the words you say in the air. The above section is what you want people to pay attention to, so you slice a big gap between the above and the below words.	As you focus on <kanji>the above</kanji> words you realize a <reading>guy</reading> (<ja>がい</ja>) is trying to push the rest of the things you're saying back up with the rest of them. No! The above text is all that matters! Go away guy!	That guy doesn't care if the above is all he's supposed to hear. That guy sucks.		8214	-	kanji Lesson_55

If you can't run on your toes, well then you're out of luck, and you won't be able to <kanji>move on</kanji> at all. I didn't make this rule, I just enforce it. Now run!	Imagine trying to proceed down the road by running on your toes. No other part of your foot can touch the ground!	If you find that you can't <kanji>proceed</kanji>, you're a <reading>foo</reading>l (<ja>ふ</ja>). Everyone can run on their toes. Don't you know that? No? Then you're an even bigger fool, now get outta here!	Imagine being called a fool when you can't proceed along the road because running on your toes ends up being super hard to do.		8215	-	kanji Lesson_55

If you think about it, bone marrow is really just a road for tiny blood scooters.	If you put your ear really close a bone with <kanji>marrow</kanji> still in it, you'll hear the scooters going <reading>zuwee</reading> (<ja>ずい</ja>) as they move the blood around inside there.	That's how doctors can tell if there's something wrong with your bone marrow. If they can't hear the zuuwee of the scooters, you're gonna die soon.

He can't go far because there's obviously something wrong with his feet. He's stuck nearby, very close to your side.	Picture the leader very close to your side. He's looking off into the distance, a distance he'll never get to because all he can do is stand there with his messed up feet.	You decide to bring the leader to a <kanji>nearby</kanji> <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) alley. It's really close and you can stay right by his side as he throws bowling balls and gets his anger out.	Picture the leader bowling nearby.

累	Kanji	田, 糸	Rice Paddy, Thread	radical, radical	Accumulate	Accumulate		<reading>るい</reading>				るい									You start growing <radical>thread</radical> in your <radical>rice paddy</radical> to <kanji>accumulate</kanji> more. You didn't want to have to buy any, so you're just trying to grow thread with your rice. That seems like a good way to accumulate more to you.	Just imagine how much thread you'll accumulate if you can just grow it along with your rice in the rice paddy! So much thread!	Sadly, this is a terrible way to <kanji>accumulate</kanji> anything thread related and you ended up <reading>rui</reading>ning (<ja>るい</ja>) your rice paddy too. I guess if you want to accumulate thread this isn't the way to do it.	Your attempts to accumulate more of something by cheating have brought ruin to everything else you were doing.

If it doesn't get <kanji>healing</kanji> soon, it will die.	Maybe the Death Star wouldn't be sick if it wasn't so mean to you, yelling at you for living in a yurt, when it was a yurt on the inside the whole time. Wait! I know the cure!	You realized that the only way to <kanji>cure</kanji> the Death Star is to turn it back into a <reading>yu</reading>rt (<ja>ゆ</ja>). Then it won't be able to do any more harm, and its outside will reflect its pleasant self on the inside!	Hmm, but does this type of yurt healing technology exist?!

Why? Because that sock is now enclosed in that building!	Now that you have an <kanji>enclosure</kanji>, let's go deeper. Put a <reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>) in the sock and it becomes an enclosure inside an enclosure.	Picture this inception enclosure mess in your mind and you'll never forget this kanji, I promise.		8220	-	kanji Lesson_55
尿	Kanji	尸, 水	Flag, Water	radical, radical	Urine, Pee	Urine, Pee		<reading>にょう</reading>				にょう									When you go to the pool or lake to swim, you'll see a <radical>flag</radical> stuck somewhere in the <radical>water</radical>. That flag is there so you know it's okay to <kanji>pee</kanji> in that area of the pool. Everyone knows <kanji>urine</kanji> dilutes in water, and if everyone just pees in one place, it won't be gross. So go pee over by that flag when you have to go. Don't bother getting out of the water.	Imagine swimming over to the flag that's sticking out of the water and peeing there. Yeah, everyone knows what you're doing over there, but it's better than getting out and walking to the bathroom right? Just pee in the water. Just do it.	"Right as you start to <kanji>pee</kanji>, you hear the life guard start to yell, ""<reading>NYOOOOOO</reading>! (<ja>にょう</ja>)"" and he's pointing at you! You were just peeing by the pee flag! Why is he mad?"	Imagine your embarrassment when you find out that you aren't supposed to urinate in the water, not even by the pee flag, because a life guard yelled NYOOOOOO and pointed right at you while you did it.		8221	-	kanji Lesson_55

This is because we invited some <kanji>VIP</kanji> <kanji>guest</kanji>s into our home and they ate all our shellfish.	The VIPs came into our home (the place between our roof and the ground) where they consumed all our shellfish. Only the best for guests, I guess.	These <kanji>VIP</kanji> <kanji>guest</kanji>s are part of a <reading>Hin</reading>du (<ja>ひん</ja>) envoy. 	We are treating these VIP guests extra special because they represent the whole Hindu religion. They get shellfish because of course we weren't going to serve them beef!		8222	-	kanji Lesson_55
虜	Kanji	虍, 男	Tiger, Man	radical, radical	Captive	Captive		<reading>りょ</reading> <reading>ろ</reading>	とりく とりこ			りょ, ろ	とりく, とりこ								When a <radical>man</radical> meets a <radical>tiger</radical> he makes the tiger his <kanji>captive</kanji>. Men are pretty crappy like that. They see tigers and they want to put them in cages, so the poor tiger becomes a captive of the man.	Picture the sad tiger captive and the man laughing as he pokes at it. Tigers shouldn't be captives but when men find them they always seem to do this anyway.	The <kanji>captive</kanji> tiger is even sadder because the man put him in a <reading>ro</reading>be (<ja>りょ</ja>) and is making him act like a human. Tigers look good in robes, but they don't really enjoy being forced into people clothing.	Picture the poor captive tiger being stuffed into a bathrobe and paraded around a cage for the man.		8223	-	kanji Lesson_55

Remorse for the people it left behind. <kanji>Regret</kanji>s for the things it did and didn't do.	If you died right now and left your soul behind, do you think you'd have regrets?	The soul with the most <kanji>regret</kanji>s is Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>). Everyone knows to stay away from him in the spirit world because he's so sad. Not because of his own actions, but because of the state of his people now.	Picture Genghis Khan looking down at the state of his people, the Mongols, in the modern world. See the remorse in his soul's face. They should be leaders of the modern world. Not reduced to a people struggling in the background.		8224	-	kanji Lesson_55

Even though the gun is small, it's still a step up from a bow.	Imagine increasing your power with a new weapon. What would it be?	You keep trading in weapons to get <kanji>increasing</kanji>ly stronger gear, when you realize that at the top of the list is... a <reading>Ya</reading>nkee's (<ja>や</ja>) baseball bat? Huh. I would have gone for a tank or a bazooka. But I guess if this will increase your power level, you have to go for it.	Imagine walking down a line of weapons, each one increasing in power from the one before it. Bow, small gun, bigger gun, tank, Yankee's bat. Yup, that sounds right.		8225	-	kanji Lesson_55
粗	Kanji	米, 且	Rice, Top Hat	radical, radical	Coarse, Rough	Coarse, Rough		<reading>そ</reading>	あら			そ	あら								If you find some <radical>rice</radical> in a <radical>top hat</radical> it's going to be really <kanji>coarse</kanji> and <kanji>rough</kanji>. Probably because it's not the kind that's meant to be eaten.	Imagine trying to eat the rice you found in a top hat. It's so coarse it feels like it's scratching your teeth. There's probably some dirt in here too. This wasn't the best idea.	You take the <kanji>coarse</kanji> rice and try to wash it with <reading>so</reading>ap (<ja>そ</ja>).	If you were trying to make this coarse rice taste like soap, you did it. But if you were trying to make it less coarse, well... sorry, but that's not how anything works.		8226	-	kanji Lesson_55

The pope is wearing really heavy robes and it's hot up here on this cliff, so you both need to walk in circles to keep cool.	Imagine this strange circulation of you and the pope up here on a cliff. It's not even like you two are up here for a reason, you're just loitering. But he doesn't want to be hot so he makes you circulate with him.	This <kanji>circulation</kanji> wouldn't have to even be happening if it wasn't <reading>June</reading> (<ja>じゅん</ja>). The cliffs are so hot in June, and in any other month the two of you would have just sat down and had a chat. But in June you have to do this weird circulation dance.

It will <kanji>freeze</kanji>, but it will get kinda yucky too. Your doubts will affect the ice-making process, so try not to be so worried and unsure next time you want normal ice.	Imagine looking over water in an ice cube tray. You aren't sure if they'll turn out alright, and you doubt whether ice is even a thing. As you think this, the water congeals and freezes into gross shapes.	You always end up <kanji>congeal</kanji>ing your <reading>gyo</reading>za (<ja>ぎょう</ja>) this way. You want to <kanji>freeze</kanji> your leftover gyoza so you can enjoy it later, but you doubt it will turn out all right and it always congeals in a gross, half-frozen gyoza block. Yuck!

Imagine how much height you'd gain if you spent time lifting weights on the moon!	Getting a taller <kanji>stature</kanji> will also make you seem super <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>) on the moon and back home on earth.

They work all day, then as the first sun sets, the second one rises and they get a new burst of energy. The whole planet lives in a state of <kanji>prosperity</kanji> because of the two suns.	Picture the prosperous planet that has two suns. They get so much work done that no one is ever hungry or tired or without.	The person on this planet with two suns who benefits from the prosperity the most is the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>). Yes, this planet still has a shougun as their leader, but everything is going so well that they didn't see a need to change. The shogun will be in charge of this prosperous world forever.

The <kanji>pleasant</kanji> soul within the Death Star actually looks like a <reading>yu</reading>rt (<ja>ゆ</ja>), not a big angry, metal ball.	Yurts are very pleasant structures.

Imagine your fingers slowly getting closer and closer to the jet's engine. It feels like it's going to suck your whole body in.

You're almost done <kanji>eras</kanji>ing your fingers when the jet starts sucking all of you in. You would try to grab the closest thing to you, but your fingers don't exist anymore, so you hold onto the <reading>mats</reading> (<ja>まつ</ja>) at your feet with your toes. The mats are super strong (they're made for jets, after all) and you manage to save yourself!	Now you're so thankful to the mats. If they weren't there you might have erased your whole body!
