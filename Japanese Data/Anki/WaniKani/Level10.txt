各	Radical				Kiss	Kiss															When you combine winter and mouth you get... winter mouth! Or at least a mouth that tastes like winter because it's coming in for a <radical>kiss</radical>. Before you go kissing people you eat mints, right? It's common courtesy so you don't give them a mouth full of bad breath. So when you think of a winter mouth, think of a nice, minty kiss!					1435	-	Lesson_10 radical
豆	Radical				Beans	Beans															This radical has a pod (the square in the middle) between the ground and some roots. That pod is going to turn into a plant someday. What plant will it be? Great big <radical>beans</radical>, like the ones from Jack and the Beanstalk.					1436	-	Lesson_10 radical

頁	Radical				Geoduck	Geoduck															This radical consists of a shellfish with a leaf on it. What is it? The mysterious <radical>geoduck</radical>. It's a very distinct clam-like creature. If you don't know what a geoduck is, look it up. It's quite bizarre. It has a long, leaf-shaped protrusion coming out of its shell body.					1439	-	Lesson_10 radical
曲	Radical				Music	Music															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>music</radical>.					1440	-	Lesson_10 radical
丙	Radical				Dynamite	Dynamite															Doesn't this radical look like one of those old-fashioned <radical>dynamite</radical> plunger things that gets pushed to set the fuse? That makes this dynamite!					1441	-	Lesson_10 radical
疒	Radical				Sick	Sick															This is the canopy radical with ice running down the back. If you hang out in a cold canopy like this you'll definitely get <radical>sick</radical>. Imagine being sick and alone inside a cold canopy. Brrrr, oh no... ACHOO!					1442	-	Lesson_10 radical
乃	Radical				Stairs	Stairs															See the <radical>stairs</radical> shape on the right side? Also note it's being held up by a pillar or beam or something, to make sure the stairs don't just collapse as you walk up them.					1443	-	Lesson_10 radical
束	Radical				Bundle	Bundle, Ent															This is a tree with something wrapped around its middle, holding it tight. If you unwrapped that middle part you'd realize it's actually a bunch of trees tied in there. It's a <radical>bundle</radical> of trees!					1444	-	Lesson_10 radical
隹	Radical				Turkey	Turkey															This looks kind of like the top of the bird radical, but not quite. It's kind of a dumb-looking bird radical top. What's a dumb bird, so dumb that it would look into the sky to drown itself with its mouth open? A <radical>turkey</radical>.					1445	-	Lesson_10 radical
失	Radical				Fault	Fault															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>fault</radical>.					1446	-	Lesson_10 radical

<i class=radical-chinese></i>	Radical				Chinese	Chinese															Why is your husband putting flowers in his mouth? It's because he's <radical>Chinese</radical>. It's just something they do over there, you explain. Tea is flower water, this isn't that weird. Chinese people just thought of doing it first.					1448	-	Lesson_10 radical
始	Kanji	女, 台	Woman, Machine	radical, radical	Begin, Start	Begin, Start		<reading>し</reading>	はじ			し	はじ								If you give a <radical>woman</radical> a <radical>machine</radical> she'll <kanji>begin</kanji> learning how to use it right away. She'll also get it to <kanji>start</kanji> before anyone else could. Women are really good at starting up new machines!	Picture a woman seeing a new machine and beginning work on it right away to see how she can start it up.	Actually, before she can <kanji>begin</kanji>, she has to shear the <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) over there. The machine is going to turn wool into yarn, but you can't just start that process by shoving the sheep in there. You have to keep the little sheep safe!	Picture a machine starting up as the woman begins to shear the sheep. Picture the sheep staring at you, staring at it.		1449	-	kanji Lesson_10
起	Kanji	走, 己	Run, Oneself	radical, radical	Wake Up	Wake Up		き	<reading>お</reading>			お	き								<radical>Run</radical> into <radical>oneself</radical> in a dream and you'll definitely <kanji>wake up</kanji>.	If you run into yourself, it really messes you up, you know? You won't be able to handle what you're seeing so you have to wake up.	If one runs into oneself and you don't <kanji>wake up</kanji>, just look down at your waist. If you're wearing an <reading>o</reading>bi (<ja>お</ja>) you know it's a dream and you'll eventually wake up. If you aren't wearing an obi then it isn't a dream and you don't have anything to wake up from.	Your obi is like a special object you only have in dreams. If you have your obi, it's okay, it's a dream and you can wake up now! Make sure you memorize exactly how it feels so dream-you can't trick you or something.		1450	-	kanji Lesson_10
速	Kanji	⻌, 束	Scooter, Bundle	radical, radical	Fast	Fast		<reading>そく</reading>	はや			そく	はや								You jump on your <radical>scooter</radical> with a big <radical>bundle</radical> to go as <kanji>fast</kanji> as you can! You have a bundle of pizzas in here, and they need to be delivered as fast as you can get them there!	Imagine how fast you can go on your scooter holding this bundle. It's way faster than trying to go on foot, that's for sure!	You were going so <kanji>fast</kanji>, you only put on <reading>sock</reading>s (<ja>そく</ja>). So now you're barreling down the street at top speeds in just your sad, white socks.	Imagine riding the scooter as fast as you can in just your socks. You can feel the wind pulling them off your feet!		1451	-	kanji Lesson_10
配	Kanji	酉, 己	Alcohol, Oneself	radical, radical	Distribute	Distribute		<reading>はい</reading>	くば			はい	くば								You don't want to keep all the <radical>alcohol</radical> to yourself (<radical>oneself</radical>), so you <kanji>distribute</kanji> it to all of your friends. Heck, not just your friends, to everyone you can find!	Don't be that person who keeps the alcohol all to themselves. Distribute it to all of the legally-aged people you know!	As you <kanji>distribute</kanji> the alcohol you say a <reading>hai</reading>ku (<ja>はい</ja>):  Here you go my friends Alcohol for everyone Never drink alone	This becomes the haiku you say before every party, every potluck, and every night out at the bar. You even get it tattoo'd to your arm.		1452	-	kanji Lesson_10
酒	Kanji	氵, 酉	Tsunami, Alcohol	radical, radical	Alcohol	Alcohol		<reading>しゅ</reading>	さけ さか			しゅ	さけ, さか								A <radical>tsunami</radical> is an <radical>alcohol</radical>ic beverage containing a lot of <kanji>alcohol</kanji>. It’s 3 different kinds of rums, pineapple juice, and grenadine. It’ll hit you like a tsunami though. This alcoholic drink has a kick to it.	It’s made with spiced rum, coconut rum, and dark rum. Imagine yourself on a sandy beach drinking this cocktail. Feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair as you sip on this fruity and rummy alcoholic beverage known as a tsunami. You could even picture an actual tsunami in the water coming right for you. I wouldn’t recommend it though—actual tsunami are scary, not drinkable and delicious.	As you lay on this beach, the <kanji>alcohol</kanji> keeps coming down a <reading>chu</reading>te (<ja>しゅ</ja>), straight into your mouth. You can feel the sand in your toes and the alcohol sliding down your throat from this special tsunami chute.	Picture the alcohol flowing down this long chute from somewhere far away. You try to see where it's coming from, but all you can see is this long, long chute stretching along the entire beach, until it disappears into the distance. You should probably be concerned that you're nonstop drinking alcohol from a random chute, but it tastes so good!		1453	-	kanji Lesson_10
院	Kanji	阝, 宀, 元	Building, Roof, Origin	radical, radical, radical	Institution	Institution		<reading>いん</reading>				いん									This <radical>building</radical> has a <radical>roof</radical> and will teach you about the <radical>origin</radical> of many things. It's an <kanji>institution</kanji>!	Institutions are places of learning, but they have to be a physical place with a roof and all that. If you're learning out in a field somewhere, that's probably not a proper institution.	What does <kanji>institution</kanji> start with? In (<ja>いん</ja>)!	Just remember, it's an IN-stitution, and you'll know this reading easy-peasy.		1454	-	kanji Lesson_10
終	Kanji	糸, 夂, 二	Thread, Winter, Two	radical, radical, radical	End, Finish	End, Finish		<reading>しゅう</reading>	おわ お			しゅう	おわ, お								The <radical>thread</radical> of <radical>winter</radical> splits in <radical>two</radical> when the year comes to an <kanji>end</kanji>. One half symbolizes the year you were just in, and the other symbolizes the new year beginning, cutting winter in half and <kanji>finish</kanji>ing off the year.	Picture the threads that symbolize winter splitting in two to mark the end of the year. Winter isn't finished though, it's only half done.	Right as winter <kanji>end</kanji>s you grab the two threads and lace them into your <reading>shoe</reading>s (<ja>しゅう</ja>). Oh, you thought these were metaphorical? No they're real threads, although, they're technically shoe laces now.	It's the end of the year, so it's time for new shoe laces!		1455	-	kanji Lesson_10
習	Kanji	羽, 白	Feathers, White	radical, radical	Learn	Learn		<reading>しゅう</reading>	なら			しゅう	なら								You find some <radical>white</radical> <radical>feathers</radical> and you want to <kanji>learn</kanji> more about where they came from and what they're made of.	Picture yourself in a library poring through huge tomes on birds, feathers, and the history of white birds. You want to learn everything you can!	You <kanji>learn</kanji> that you should tie these white feathers to your <reading>shoe</reading>s (<ja>しゅう</ja>). You do it before you learn what it will do, and then suddenly you're jump-flying out of the building.	Oh geez, oh no. You better learn how to control these shoes before you—CRASH!!! Welp, you just shot through a plane. You need to learn more before you act next time.		1456	-	kanji Lesson_10
転	Kanji	車, 云	Car, Cloud	radical, radical	Revolve	Revolve		<reading>てん</reading>	ころ			てん	ころ								If your <radical>car</radical> runs into a <radical>cloud</radical> you'll <kanji>revolve</kanji> around it instead of going straight through. Clouds are really hard to see through, so even though you're trying not to, you revolve in a tight circle up and around the cloud anyway.	Imagine driving your car around and around the cloud, instead of going through it. At least it's soft and cool.	You have to <kanji>revolve</kanji> around the cloud <reading>ten</reading> (<ja>てん</ja>) times before it disappears and you're able to go through.	Unfortunately, not long after you get through that cloud another one comes down and gets in your way. Now you're counting each revolution, one... two... three... all the way up to ten.		1457	-	kanji Lesson_10
進	Kanji	⻌, 隹	Scooter, Turkey	radical, radical	Advance	Advance		<reading>しん</reading>	すす			しん	すす								You give your <radical>scooter</radical> to a <radical>turkey</radical> so that it can <kanji>advance</kanji>. The turkey was trying and failing to walk through a crowded street, so out of the goodness of your heart you gave it a scooter so it could advance.	Imagine picking up the turkey and putting it on your scooter. Of course, you give it your helmet as well, safety first.	You wave as the turkey <kanji>advance</kanji>s into the street at top speeds, collides with a car, and scrapes up its <reading>shin</reading>s (<ja>しん</ja>) almost immediately. Ah!	Silly turkey, you can't advance that fast, of course you'll hurt your shins. It's better to advance slowly, but I guess I couldn't expect you to know that.		1458	-	kanji Lesson_10
落	Kanji	艹, 氵, 各	Flowers, Tsunami, Kiss	radical, radical, radical	Fall	Fall		<reading>らく</reading>	お			らく	お								A violent <radical>tsunami</radical> causes <radical>flowers</radical> to be ripped from the branches of trees and they swirl around and <radical>kiss</radical> your face gently as they <kanji>fall</kanji>. With the tsunami came a great windy storm that blew many flowers all about. It’s a pretty sight amongst all the destruction.	Imagine being out in this tsunami induced storm. You can feel the rain and wind on your skin – you’re wet, cold, and scared. But you see some flowers being blown to the ground and you are mesmerized by the dance they do on the wind before they finally fall to the ground.	You want to save these flowers you see <kanji>fall</kanji>ing in around you, so you take out a drying <reading>rack</reading> (<ja>らく</ja>) and place them carefully on it. Now whenever you feel scared, you can look at the flowers on this rack and you won't be scared anymore.	Imagine running around catching the flowers as they fall. Imagine placing each little petal onto the rack to keep it safe and dry.		1459	-	kanji Lesson_10

Leaves, no matter how little, are the most important thing in the world for them.	"Picture a little flower working really hard to grow its first leaf. The <kanji>leaf</kanji> pops out and it shouts, ""<reading>Ha</reading> (<ja>は</ja>)!"""	<ja>は</ja> is the sound of a leaf coming into existence.

軽	Kanji	車, 圣	Car, Tombstone	radical, radical	Lightweight, Light, Light Weight	Lightweight, Light, Light Weight		けい	<reading>かる</reading> <reading>かろ</reading>			かる, かろ	けい								A <radical>tombstone</radical> may be heavy for a human, but to a <radical>car</radical>, they’re relatively <kanji>lightweight</kanji>. Cars are very strong, you see, so something heavy like a tombstone is no match for them. All cars find tombstones to be lightweight and easy to transport.	Picture yourself trying to move a huge slab tombstone. It’s difficult, no? I bet you wish you had a car or some other vehicle to make the process much less painful. Your arms are getting sore from carrying the tombstone and you’re getting sweaty and hot from all the work. What you would do for a car with air conditioning.	What do you wish you had to transport this tombstone? Oh, that’s right – a <reading>car</reading> (<ja>かる</ja>). If you had a car, this tombstone moving business would be no problem. To cars, tombstones are naught but <kanji>lightweight</kanji> pebbles!	Remember all that hard work you were doing before and how you got all sweaty and gross? Now imagine yourself inside of a nice car with air conditioning, and the tombstone in the trunk. It feels great doesn’t it? The air conditioning is perfect, and driving a car is much easier than carrying a tombstone around.		1461	-	kanji Lesson_10

The scooter doesn't fit in the car when you aren't on it though, so you have to carry it out the window. And it takes a lot of <kanji>luck</kanji> not to get clipped by a car or accidentally take out a pedestrian with it.	Imagine trying to carry your scooter out the window. Your forehead is still sticking out of the car as you do this.	As you <kanji>carry</kanji> the scooter, your <kanji>luck</kanji> turns, and it starts to rain, so you pull out your <reading>um</reading>brella (<ja>うん</ja>). Now you're holding your scooter, your forehead, and an umbrella outside of the car.	It's hard enough to carry a scooter while you drive, but now you have to try to keep yourself and it dry with an umbrella too. 		1462	-	kanji Lesson_10

That's convenient, since it's pretty dark out and you might not have seen the open gate without the lantern's help.	Imagine being a traveler, walking around the outside of a huge walled city. You really need to get inside but all of the gates are closed. Finally, you see a single, bright lantern marking the open gate! What a relief.	This <kanji>open</kanji> gate is in the water though, so you'll need a <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>) to get in. Luckily, you've been carrying your kayak with you just in case.	Imagine kayaking in the dark toward an open gate. Finally, you've made it!		1463	-	kanji Lesson_10

At least, you will once you've <kanji>gather</kanji>ed enough turkeys into this one tree.	Collect another turkey, send it flying and gobbling up into the tree next to the other one.	Once you've <kanji>collect</kanji>ed enough turkeys, you're going to turn them into a <reading>shoe</reading> (<ja>しゅう</ja>). Maybe even two shoes, but that will mean <kanji>gather</kanji>ing even more turkeys!	Picture the nice, feathered shoes you'll be able to make once you've gathered all of these turkeys together. Ohoho, you can't wait! Go collect another turkey!		1464	-	kanji Lesson_10

You can't live just from eating, you have to drink things too!	Imagine eating and eating and lacking a delicious, cold, thirst-quenching drink. Your mouth is dry. You have to drink something, anything!	You get desperate for a <kanji>drink</kanji> and put some <reading>no</reading>ri (<ja>の</ja>) seaweed in a blender, trying to create a drink of your own.	Luckily, this nori isn't dried and pressed like they usually are, and you manage to make a bright green nori drink.

Don’t sheep usually eat like, grass and stuff? What is this sheep doing trying to eat a fish with spikes on its fins? What silly business this is.	Imagine this crazy sheep. Why is it trying to eat this fish? This sheep is blood crazed. Blood crazed for fish meat, especially the meat from fish with spikes on their fins. This crazed sheep means business.	What’s this? The sheep is also trying to eat some <reading>gyo</reading>za (<ja>ぎょう</ja>) dumplings! Where will this sheep’s madness end? First spikey finned fish and now gyoza? This is some crazy <kanji>business</kanji>.	Imagine you’re at an Asian style restaurant and you just ordered a big plate of gyoza dumplings. Next thing you know, this crazy sheep busts through the front door and starts devouring all your gyoza! Where did this sheep come from and why does he love gyoza so much!?		1466	-	kanji Lesson_10

Picture the world way far away, from space. You see a giant tsunami carve out a massive chunk of land to the west of Japan on the main continent. Slowly the tsunami waters recede, leaving the outline of China.	You peer closer at <kanji>China</kanji> and realize the borders are inching inward, even though the tsunami is already gone. You look even closer and see the Mongols, being led by Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) moving in to conquer all of the Chinese people living in China!	Watch as the Khan takes China for himself. A tiny little flag with a horse on it is raised in the middle, for all of the Chinese people to see. Hmm, this could be a problem.		1467	-	kanji Lesson_10

Your feet are filthy, sweaty, and stinky. Nobody is going to want to kiss those feet.	Imagine kissing someone’s foot. Now imagine kissing someone’s foot after they’ve been walking down a dirt road for hours. It’s disgusting. Smell the stench of dirt and sweat wafting up into your nostrils as the foot approaches your lips. It’s wretched.	What was this person walking down again? Oh, that’s right – a <reading>ro</reading>ad (<ja>ろ</ja>). They were walking down a dirt <kanji>road</kanji>.	Walking down a dirt road barefoot like this is a sure way to dirty up your feet.

I’m sure you’ve pressed your ear up against a wall, door, or gate at sometime to hear what’s going on on the other side of it.

As long as there are five different people saying these same words with their five mouths, it's considered its own language.	Picture these five mouths saying the same language to each other. They can understand each other! The mouths are smiling and laughing too.	Another mouth joins in speaking the <kanji>language</kanji>, but it's green and scaled and... it's <reading>Go</reading>dzilla's (<ja>ご</ja>) mouth! Godzilla speaks this language too.	"Godzilla speaks a language some people understand! You wish you knew this earlier, then you might have been able to stop some of his destruction.

Imagine reading what you have for sale out loud to people walking by because they’re too lazy to read it for themselves.	What are you forced to <kanji>read</kanji> aloud to sell? <reading>Yo-</reading>yo (<ja>よ</ja>) instructions! You’d think they’d be self explanatory, but there are actually a lot of rules and tricks that you have to read to get good at yo-yoing. Read all of these out loud so you can sell them.

This is how birds communicate. They open their mouths and let out a series of chirps. Chirp chirp chirp!	Imagine yourself out in the wilderness on a sunny spring day. The weather is perfect and the scenery is beautiful. The only sound you can hear is the chirp of birds throughout the woods around you. It’s very peaceful.	The best place to experience the <kanji>chirp</kanji> chirping of birds is when you’re out in <reading>na</reading>ture (<ja>な</ja>). You’re not going to hear birds chirping in a crowded city, so you need to get out into nature to fully experience the birds and their chirps.	Nature is a great place to clear your mind and relax.

The person who threw you that <kanji>line</kanji> of thread is actually a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<ja>せん</ja>). How kind of him.

You’ve marked it with a yellow X so the hired help knows which tree to cut down. There are a lot of trees on the side of the house, but the tree marked with a yellow X is the only one in danger of causing damage to your roof in the event of a storm.	Picture the scene of a woman with a chainsaw cutting down this tree marked with a yellow X. Hear the sound of the chainsaw buzzing and the grinding of wood as it meets the side of the trunk. It’s very loud. Woodchips go flying everywhere.	Wait, that woman with the chainsaw is <reading>Yoko</reading> (<ja>よこ</ja>) Ono! Yes, the same Yoko Ono who’s married to John Lennon of the Beatles. What’s she doing chopping down trees on the <kanji>side</kanji> of your house? Who can say. Silly Yoko.	Now picture the same scene as before only imagining Yoko Ono wielding that chainsaw.

You've looked around this whole area, making a big circle around it, because you are trying to <kanji>investigate</kanji> something that happened here. You also say this thing in a really quiet <kanji>tone</kanji> of voice, because you don't want the person or thing you're investigating to know you're on to them.	Because the radical <radical>circumference</radical> is in play, you can think of the crime scene you're investigating as a statue of a giant globe, and you're doing a circumference around it. Then, in the reading, we'll think about what you'll <radical>say</radical>.	"""I came here to <kanji>investigate</kanji> this place, and I did indeed find out who the criminal is... it's none other than Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>)!"""

This is a kind and caring parent who can see that you are tired and want to relax by standing in the shade of this tree.	Imagine that you’re on a long mountain hike and so far you’ve been hiking all in the sun with no shade. Feel the sun beating down on your back, the sweat getting in your eyes. Finally you see a tree to seek refuge under. It’s like an oasis in a desert. You’re saved!	Once you get closer to the tree, you and your <kanji>parent</kanji> see that it has some pretty crazy roots coming out of it. While making your way into the shade, you manage to bang your <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>) on one of these roots. Your shins already hurt from walking so much, and this is just icing on the cake.	Busting your shins on things really hurts. I'm sure you've hit your shins on coffee tables and the like all your life. Remember that pain and think how much worse it would be banging your bare shins on pointy tree roots after you've been hiking all day in the hot sun. Not enjoyable.		1480	-	kanji Lesson_10

To a geoduck, beans are a brain food, so by eating beans, a geoduck’s head will grow incredibly large. Geoducks already look strange enough as it is, let alone with engorged heads.	Imagine, if you will, a geoduck. Now imagine that same geoduck with a massive head. It looks ridiculous, and more disgusting than ever. It’s actually really creeping you out, because the head keeps getting larger as the geoduck eats more beans. Ew.	As the geoduck eats more and more beans, its <kanji>head</kanji> gets bigger and bigger until finally the geoduck’s head explodes like an <reading>atomi</reading>c (<ja>あたま</ja>) bomb. BOOM! Geoduck parts go flying everywhere and pieces of the geoduck’s massive head float to the ground as atomic fallout.	Remember how gross geoducks are? Of course you do.

Geoducks are gross, and you back away from the edge of the cliff you were standing but a hair’s breadth away from just before. Your face is all gooey from the geoduck’s slimy residue.	Imagine being slapped in the face with a geoduck. It’s probably one of the worst things that could ever happen to someone. Those things are disgusting. Now you have geoduck goo all over your face. It’s sticky and slimy and gross.	But where did that geoduck come from anyway? As you turn around from the cliff edge, wiping the goop from your <kanji>face</kanji> and out of your eyes, you see an angry <reading>cow</reading> (<ja>かお</ja>). This cow is the one who hit you in the face with this geoduck. I know not the reason, but this cow is most definitely not happy with you.	Cows are big animals. So you probably got hit in the face with that geoduck pretty hard. Feel the geoduck shaped welt starting to form on the side of your face. It’s very painful and stings a lot.		1482	-	kanji Lesson_10

Unfortunately there are no medicines that are effective on sticks of dynamite, so once they contract a sickness, they’re sick for good.	Imagine if you were a sick stick of dynamite.

Being nervous all the time about spontaneously exploding would probably make you sweat profusely. And you know what sweating causes? <reading>B.O.</reading> (<ja>びょう</ja>). You’d be one smelly stick of dynamite. B.O. is a very unpleasant smell, and being <kanji>sick</kanji> is no excuse.	Picture this as your life.
