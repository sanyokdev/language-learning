句	Radical				Paragraph	Paragraph															You're locking the things that come out of your mouth in prison. The prison of paper and rules, that is. These words turn into well-formed <radical>paragraph</radical>s.					2309	-	Lesson_15 radical
男	Radical				Man	Man															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>man</radical>.					2310	-	Lesson_15 radical
去	Radical				Past	Past, Cemetery															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>past</radical>.					2311	-	Lesson_15 radical

丈	Radical				Height	Height															There is a narwhal at the top of this slide. What's it doing? The narwhal is trying to increase its <radical>height</radical>. Picture a narwhal propping itself up on a slide. It's self-conscious of its height. It's trying to prove to all the other narwhals that it should be allowed to play in their narwhal games, even though it's not the same height as them.					2313	-	Lesson_15 radical
<i class=radical-grass></i>	Radical				Grass	Grass															Don't confuse this with triceratops. <radical>Grass</radical> is closer together, and a little bushier, like this. It's also more random and squished down in parts. If you see a bush of lines like this, it's probably going to be grass.					2314	-	Lesson_15 radical
寺	Kanji	寺	Temple	radical	Temple	Temple		じ	<reading>てら</reading>			てら	じ								The <radical>temple</radical> radical and the <kanji>temple</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Brilliant.		Someone died. You ask how this person died, the person who's getting buried by the <kanji>temple</kanji>. The priest/monk says it was in a tragic <reading>terror</reading> (<ja>てら</ja>) attack.	That's too bad - feel sorry for the person and learn a little more about the terror attack, if it will help you to remember the reading of this kanji better.		2315	-	kanji Lesson_15
岩	Kanji	山, 石	Mountain, Stone	radical, radical	Boulder	Boulder		がん	<reading>いわ</reading>			いわ	がん								A <radical>mountain</radical> <radical>stone</radical> is probably going to be a really big stone. We're talking about a <kanji>boulder</kanji> here.	This kanji makes a lot of sense. Just follow the logic.	"Although it doesn't share the kanji, this <kanji>boulder</kanji> shares the reading of the first part of the famous ""Iwajima"" (where a big battle in WWII took place). Think of a big boulder. Now think of it plopped into the ocean to make an island. What island is it? It's <reading>Iwa</reading>jima (the historical spelling of Iwo Jima)."	Hopefully you know what / where Iwajima is. If not, do a quick history lesson to catch yourself up!		2316	-	kanji Lesson_15
帰	Kanji	刂, ヨ, 冖, 巾	Knife, Wolverine, Forehead, Towel	radical, radical, radical, radical	Return, Return Home	Return, Return Home		き	<reading>かえ</reading>			かえ	き								A <radical>knife</radical> got stuck in <radical>Wolverine</radical>'s <radical>forehead</radical>, and he has a <radical>towel</radical> wrapped around it to stop the bleeding, but he really needs to <kanji>return home</kanji>.	Everything is fun and games until someone gets hurt. And in this case, very hurt. If something like this happens, it's always best to return home.	Wolverine wants to <kanji>return home</kanji>, but he can't drive himself because there's a knife in his forehead and lots of blood, so he asks his friend the <reading>ca</reading>r <reading>e</reading>lephant (<ja>かえ</ja>) to take him. Car elephant is just an elephant mutant that has a car on his back.	Watch as Wolverine climbs up onto car elephant and returns home. Well, this party was a failure.		2317	-	kanji Lesson_15
春	Kanji	<i class=radical-spring></i>, 日	Spring, Sun	radical, radical	Spring	Spring		しゅん	<reading>はる</reading>			はる	しゅん								When you see the <radical>spring</radical> <radical>sun</radical> you know it's finally the  <kanji>spring</kanji> season.	The spring sun only comes out in spring, which is why you know for sure it's spring. Imagine a different looking sun that only comes out in spring but not the other seasons.	"When the <kanji>spring</kanji> season comes around, it makes you want to laugh: ""<reading>HAR</reading> (<ja>はる</ja>) HAR HAR!"" you yell."	"Go ahead and belt out a few ""HAR HAR HARs"" for spring. It's warming up, everything is coming to life, and you're happy. ""HAR HAR HAR!"""		2318	-	kanji Lesson_15

It doesn't do anything except for every day right at <kanji>noon</kanji>, when it tells you the time. ""Hey guyz, it's <kanji>noon</kanji>, mmk?"""	"Really try to imagine this giant shrimp on the sun as a normal thing that happens, without fail, every day. The shrimp also tells the time right at noon, every day (so important you stress remembering that it's noon, not some other time). Maybe you could have him sing a ""noon song"" in your imagination as well."	At <kanji>noon</kanji>, the shrimp also puts on its high <reading>heel</reading>s (<ja>ひる</ja>) to get ready for the evening, where it wants to make sure it looks good for the other shrimp he/she meets later on.	Right after the shrimp's announcement, imagine it struggling to put on heels, while sitting on the sun. This shrimp is almost bigger than the sun, actually, so all its struggles with its heels are easy to see.		2319	-	kanji Lesson_15
晴	Kanji	日, 青	Sun, Blue	radical, radical	Clear Up	Clear Up		せい	<reading>は</reading>			は	せい								The <radical>sun</radical> is out, the sky is <radical>blue</radical>, things have begun to <kanji>clear up</kanji>!	Look into the blue sky and imagine the clouds parting as the weather clears up and you can see the sun. Gorgeous! The beauty is so great you have to squint.	"Now that it's starting to <kanji>clear up</kanji> you can't help but laugh. ""<reading>Ha</reading> (<ja>は</ja>)! Ha ha ha!"" you laugh up into the sky. The sun feels great on your face, making you feel lively! And that blue sky ain't too shabby either."	"Say the ""ha ha ha"" part out loud while you imagine the weather clearing up.

They all turn red and orange and brown, the colors of fire. It's also fun to set grains on fire in Autumn, since it's getting colder.	Picture all the grains in autumn. Picture the all of the colors. The colors of fire.	"As the grains burn, and the season changes to autumn, imagine them yelling out in pain: ""<reading>ACK</reading> (<ja>あき</ja>)!"""	Ah yes, the sound of the seasons changing to autumn.  Ack! Ack! Ack!		2321	-	kanji Lesson_15

You can't say the size of something without measuring it first.	"Imagine trying to use your hands to show the size of this cross, but the other person shakes their head and says, ""Use your words!"" Ugh, okay, you'll have to measure it then."	You need to <kanji>measure</kanji> this cross but all you have is a <reading>ca</reading>ke (<ja>けい</ja>). Good enough! I'm sure all cakes are exactly the same size, so they're a reliable unit of measure.	"""This cross measures two cakes wide and three cakes long,"" you say."		2322	-	kanji Lesson_15

You have a yakuza knife. There are a bunch there, all in a row, so you follow suit by putting yours in the row too.	Should we put them in a <kanji>row</kanji>? <reading>Let's</reading> (<ja>れつ</ja>) put them in a row!	"Imagine a bunch of yakuza being enthusiastic about putting their knives in a row.

Picture a big pirate map, and on it are a bunch of these markers for the districts where you can find the treasures you've been searching for.	There is one <kanji>district</kanji> you're interested in, and that's the <reading>coo</reading>kie (<ja>く</ja>) district.	The treasure of the cookie district is cookies, which you want. And to be fair, even if you weren't a pirate, you'd probably want those cookies.		2324	-	kanji Lesson_15
坂	Kanji	土, 反	Dirt, Anti	radical, radical	Slope	Slope		はん	<reading>さか</reading>			さか	はん								This is <radical>anti</radical> <radical>dirt</radical>. The dirt is becoming not dirt as it goes on, forming a... <kanji>slope</kanji>! Really what is the air above a slope but anti dirt?	This is some high level thinking, but I know you can do it. Picture a slope. Now picture an anti slope (like a negative image). It's all just dirt and anti dirt at the same time! Woah! Mind Freak!	You need to know these kinds of things about <kanji>slope</kanji>s if you want to play <reading>soccer</reading> (<ja>さか</ja>). Soccer is pretty slope-intensive. You really have to know how to read their dirt and anti dirt to really get good.	Picture a slope. Now picture yourself playing soccer on the slope. Now picture your anti self playing soccer on the anti slope.		2325	-	kanji Lesson_15
式	Kanji	弋, 工	Ceremony, Construction	radical, radical	Ritual, Ceremony, Equation	Ritual, Ceremony, Equation		<reading>しき</reading>				しき									To <radical>construct</radical> a whole <radical>ceremony</radical>, you can’t just make it up on the spot. That is not a ceremony. A ceremony has a past. A ceremony is done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a <kanji>ritual</kanji> first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish ceremony.  This kanji also means <kanji>equation</kanji> for some reason too. Just think of a ceremony that involves doing math and coming up with equations. How strange would that be? Pretend you're at this ceremony.	Ritual and Ceremony kind of mean the same things, sort of. Don't worry too much if you mix them up a little - both will help you to remember the other. There's a reason this kanji is made up of the ceremony radical already!	So, you’re at a <kanji>ritual</kanji>. Think of the most ridiculous ceremony you can think of. Give it a shot – I’ll let you come up with the ridiculousness this time (it’s good practice). When you think of your mnemonic, make sure to imagine it with a Sheikh (an Arabic leader). Have the sheikh do something ridiculous to help you to think of this sheikh (<ja>しき</ja>) and then remember this on’yomi.	It’s good to practice making your own mnemonics up every once in a while. It’ll help you to add on to the mnemonics already here and make better ones more personal to yourself!		2326	-	kanji Lesson_15
信	Kanji	ｲ, 言	Leader, Say	radical, radical	Believe, Trust	Believe, Trust		<reading>しん</reading>				しん									You <radical>say</radical> to your <radical>leader</radical>, “<kanji>Believe</kanji> and <kanji>trust</kanji> in me, I’m responsible.” The leader doesn’t think you can handle your duties, so this is why you said this to him. You want him to believe and trust you. You can handle this task.	Imagine yourself saying this to your leader. Say it out loud as you imagine saying it to a leader of some sort.	To show you are serious as you say, “<kanji>Believe</kanji> and <kanji>trust</kanji> in me, I’m responsible,” you kneel down on each <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>). You have shin splints, so it hurts a bit, but you do it anyway to show how serious you are.	Picture yourself pleading with your leader to trust and believe in you. Imagine the hurt of your shins with the shin splints as you kneel. It hurts a lot, but it proves how serious you are.		2327	-	kanji Lesson_15

"When all alone, though, the man has no courage. It helps when his mama is there to back him up. Imagine a man's mama standing there with him, saying ""you can do it, boy"" while giving him reassurance."	A man needs <kanji>courage</kanji> to stand up to all the <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>) of the world. They are too numerous and difficult to understand. It's scary, but the man has courage thanks to his mom.	Imagine a courageous man (and his reassuring mama) standing against the youths. They tell him things about modern technology and avocado toast, but thanks to his mama the man can keep his courage.		2328	-	kanji Lesson_15
単	Kanji	単	Simple	radical	Simple	Simple		<reading>たん</reading>				たん									The <radical>simple</radical> radical and the <kanji>simple</kanji> kanji are the same!	Simple is simple!	One of the most <kanji>simple</kanji> things in the world is getting a <reading>tan</reading> (<ja>たん</ja>). All you have to do is stand outside long enough. It doesn't matter what skin type you have or what the weather is like. Eventually, if you stand out there long enough, you'll get a tan.	Get a tan, it's simple, stupid! (Though it's terrible for you so uh... don't always take our advice, kay?)		2329	-	kanji Lesson_15

They’re the <kanji>director</kanji> of a movie. They try to look all mysterious, but you know it’s just so people go see their movies and think they’re cool. Really they’re just a creep deep down.	Picture the creepiest director you know. Wearing a cloak and cackling as he directs your favorite actors.	The <kanji>director</kanji> is currently directing a movie about <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>). He keeps petting them and talking to them like they're humans.	The creep director gets really into whatever his current project is. Picture him wearing a sheep costume with the cape over it, petting and whispering to his sheep cast.		2330	-	kanji Lesson_15
変	Kanji	赤, 夂	Red, Winter	radical, radical	Change, Strange	Change, Strange		<reading>へん</reading>	か			へん	か								If the snow in <radical>winter</radical> was <radical>red</radical> instead of white, that’d be a <kanji>strange</kanji> <kanji>change</kanji> wouldn’t you say? White snow is normal, red would just be strange. Can you imagine what it would be like if the winter snow changed to the color of red?	This strange change radical is a modified version of the red radical. Use that to remember it. It’s a strange change from the normal red radical.	You know what else is a <kanji>strange</kanji> thing to <kanji>change</kanji>? The color of a <reading>hen</reading> (<ja>へん</ja>). Hens are already red, so we’d change them to another color, like purple. That would be a pretty strange color for a hen, right?	Imagine if hens were purple, or even other strange colors. It would be an unexpected change. Imagine this army of rainbow colored hens strutting around and clucking up a storm.		2331	-	kanji Lesson_15

How useful, unlike some husbands, I'd imagine.		What do all <kanji>husband</kanji>s love? <reading>Foo</reading>d (<ja>ふう</ja>)! Can you hear your future husband? He’s saying,” Fooooood! FOOOOOD!” like some kind of food craving zombie. 	Husbands love eating food. Who doesn’t though, really?		2332	-	kanji Lesson_15

You do the bridge pose, and in your mind you imagine your brush painting an actual bridge. When you open your eyes, there it is! A bridge has been built, leading straight to your front door.	"You <kanji>build</kanji> a bridge. Immediately after, someone is climbing up onto it. It's <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>) the samurai. He waves at you and says, ""Did you build this? The craftsmanship is amazing."""	It seems like Ken the samurai really appreciates your building skills.		2333	-	kanji Lesson_15
昨	Kanji	日, 乍	Sun, Key	radical, radical	Previous, Yesterday	Previous, Yesterday		<reading>さく</reading>				さく									With the right <radical>key</radical> you can unlock the <radical>sun</radical> to <kanji>yesterday</kanji>, or a <kanji>previous</kanji> day. The sun is in charge of the day changes, so if you use a key to unlock it, you can control the flow of time and return to yesterday, or a previous day in the past. Behold the power of the sun.	Imagine having the power to control time like this. Picture yourself unlocking the sun to go back in time. Feel the heat of the sun and the bright light in your eyes as you unlock the door to the past.	Time traveling to a <kanji>previous</kanji> time, like <kanji>yesterday</kanji>, can be rough on the body. As such, you wear a small <reading>sack</reading> (<ja>さく</ja>) to hold your valuables while you’re ripped through the sands of time. The sack keeps your important stuff from getting lost. The sack holds your key to the sun as well.	Imagine wearing this sack as you’re sucked through the vortex of time and space. Feel yourself spinning around as you hurtle back into yesterday.		2334	-	kanji Lesson_15

To keep life safely inside the window, put that poison down.	If anything's worse than <kanji>poison</kanji> it's doing Su<reading>doku</reading> (<ja>どく</ja>) puzzles.	Have you done Sudoku before? Imagine yourself completing these puzzles and concentrating really hard. They’re fun, but also challenging.		2335	-	kanji Lesson_15
法	Kanji	氵, 去	Tsunami, Past	radical, radical	Method, Law	Method, Law		<reading>ほう</reading>				ほう									<radical>Tsunami</radical>s in the <radical>past</radical> changed the <kanji>method</kanji>s and <kanji>law</kanji>s of today.	Tsunamis used to come crashing into towns, just leveling them completely. Today we have new methods of building and protecting ourselves, and laws to keep them in place, so the past doesn't repeat itself.	These <kanji>method</kanji>s and <kanji>law</kanji>s affected your own <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>) the most.	Your home has strong walls and ceilings. You aren't allowed to leave the doors unlocked and open. These methods and laws are because of those past tsunamis and the damage they used to cause.

That tsunami is going to hit you hard, and rip you right off the ground on which you stand. And then you’ll cry like a little baby.	Imagine getting hit with the full force of a tsunami. It slams into you and crushes every bone in your body. It hurts so much you cry.	You know what else can make you <kanji>cry</kanji>? A <reading>Na</reading>zi (<ja>な</ja>). Nazis are mean, mean people, much worse than tsunamis. Nazis are bad news. Imagine a Nazi surfboarding on top of that tsunami that just hit you and made you cry. I imagine there’s nothing worse in this world than that.	Picture this mean Nazi riding toward you atop of this tsunami wave. Hear him screaming, “Heil!” just before the tsunami wave crashes over you. Rotten Nazi.		2337	-	kanji Lesson_15

After a tsunami, you want to relax with a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, tsunamis cause floods, and the bar floor is immersed in shallow water.	Picture yourself at this bar, sipping on a drink while you’re wading in this shallow water. Feel the shallow water getting your socks and shoes all wet. It’s uncomfortable and cold.	What beer are you drinking at this bar while standing in <kanji>shallow</kanji> water? You’re drinking <reading>Asa</reading>hi (<ja>あさ</ja>), the beer of the salaryman. Asahi is super dry, so it takes your attention away from the shallow water a bit.	Picture yourself in the bar again sipping on this Asahi beer.

You take this <kanji>account</kanji> and lock it with a special <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). You only give this key to people you really trust, so they can read the account of your life and truly understand you.	Picture the people in your life that you'd give this special key to.

It may seem rainy and gray at first, but if you walk right to the center you'll see all the flowers that grow there in the center of the country.

Just imagine all the people of England walking to the center, where the flowers are, and speaking English to them to help them grow.	Picture yourself in the center of England, speaking English to all of the beautiful flowers.	You keep walking to the very central center of <kanji>England</kanji> and see a giant <reading>a</reading>corn (<ja>えい</ja>) planted in the middle of the ground.

I guess there are plenty of reasons to be anti-eat right now, but you'll have to eat your food eventually.	As you stare at the <kanji>meal</kanji>, <reading>Han</reading> (<ja>はん</ja>) Solo appears before you and takes a bite! This is what happens if you don't eat your food, someone else will eat it.
