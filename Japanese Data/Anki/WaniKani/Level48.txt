The light of the pope's <kanji>shield</kanji> begins to fade. The shield's holy power is waning! Just as the demons are about to push him off the cliff, the sun begins to rise. That's right! It's <reading>June</reading> (<ja>じゅん</ja>) and summer has just begun. The pope's shield reflects the power of June's bright sun into the eyes of the demons, casting them off the cliff behind him and back into hell!	This pope would have been in a lot of trouble if June's summer sun hadn't risen at just the right moment. His shield would have become useless and he might have been shoved off the cliff if it was a less sunny month.		7285	-	kanji Lesson_48
