The drop wakes the bear up and he rolls down off the mound. After the bear rights himself, he assumes that the cross pushed him off the mound so he charges into the cross atop the mound and knocks it over.	Imagine this whole scene. A drop of water rouses the bear and he becomes enraged after he rolls down the mound. Hear the bear roar with anger as he charges up the mound and violently smashes the cross into the ground.	Once the bear fully wakes up he realizes that he just rolled down the <kanji>mound</kanji> on his own and the cross was not to blame. What a <reading>foo</reading>l (<ja>ふ</ja>) this bear was. He knows it too. The bear feels pretty foolish.	Now look at the bear sitting atop the mound with his head in his paws, looking like a fool filled with regret.

Before we had buildings it was impossible to have any prosperity in winter because everything was cold and most of us died. 	Picture a dark, bleak winter landscape. No life anywhere. Now turn around and look at the prosperity on display in the building you're in. Everyone is happy and eating food and not freezing to death.	This <kanji>prosperity</kanji> isn't good for everyone though. You look over and see Ryu (<ja>りゅう</ja>) from Street Fighter sitting in the corner. He's got everything he could ask for. He's won the tournament, he's got money, he's got this nice big building, but now he's depressed.	Ryu's prosperity has made him realize that having things isn't always enough.

If someone offers you fur coats, raise your fingers to abstain. If someone tries to get you to bully someone, raise your fingers to abstain.	Abstaining from doing what other people are doing is important sometimes. So make sure you never forget the universal abstaining symbol.	"This symbol to <kanji>abstain</kanji> comes from the <reading>hica</reading>tee (<ja>ひか</ja>) turtle. The hicatee is a Central American river turtle hunted for its meat, eggs, and shell. Therefore, the poor hicatee is endangered. So people started to rally around it, abstaining from hurting them anymore.

Picture yourself walking around and seeing a wall around some dirt. You look inside and there are some hot peppers hiding just below the surface. Phew! Good thing this wall was here to protect you from them. 	On the other side of this <kanji>wall</kanji> there are much less threatening <reading>cob</reading>s (<ja>かべ</ja>) of corn. Corn isn't spicy.

Imagine finding this tree crab in your games cabinet trying to make off with your chess piece. This tree crab is big and you weren’t expecting to find it in your games cabinet so you’re kind of terrified. You scream in horror.	Before the tree crab can make it out with the <kanji>chess piece</kanji>, you shut the door to the games cabinet and lock it with a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>), trapping the tree crab inside. Now what?	You put the key in your pocket and call animal control. They unlock the cabinet with the key and remove the tree crab from your home.

This word also means <kanji>reluctant</kanji>, because wouldn't you be reluctant to let a tsunami come wash you away with that bitter explosion of flavor in your mouth?	You're reluctant to face this bitter end at the hands of a tsunami.	With the <kanji>bitter</kanji> taste in your mouth, you <kanji>reluctant</kanji>ly gather up all of your <reading>jew</reading>els (<ja>じゅう</ja>) and wait for the tsunami to take you away.

Imagine this odd hermit leading mountain goats around the mountain, marching to the beat of a drum. It’s a strange sight indeed.	One day the <kanji>hermit</kanji> was leading the mountain goats around and he ran into a <reading>cen</reading>taur <ja>せん</ja>.

You can’t recommend this turkey. It’s probably dangerous. Imagine sending this turkey back in a restaurant, very upset with everything. Also keep in mind that the arrow is half buried in the turkey and looks a little broken since the arrow radical is a bit off.	You <kanji>recommend</kanji> the Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) special instead of this arrow-tainted turkey! When it comes out, your heart sinks.

The safe that the turkey is trying to <kanji>rob</kanji> ends up being <reading>uber</reading> (<ja>うば</ja>) big. Like, really uber big.

Feel the weight of the gun in your hands as your friend works to make the stamp honorable again. Listen to your friend complain about how there are so few people left in the world that are honorable. Also keep in mind that the correct radical is a little different with the vertical line going through the top, so just think of that as the error trying to be corrected.	"Just as you’re pondering what it means to be <kanji>honorable</kanji>, your friend gets shot by <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>). Godzilla must have been the one who ruined the stamp!
