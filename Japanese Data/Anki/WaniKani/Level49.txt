甚	Radical				Crab Trap	Crab Trap															This radical looks like a small animal (<ja>匹</ja>) has a crab (<ja>其</ja>) sticking out of it. Often when a crab is eating a small animal, that small animal was put inside a crab trap to catch the crab, luring it in with the small animal. That's why this radical is <radical>crab trap</radical>.					7393	-	Lesson_49 radical

蹴	Kanji	足, 京, 犬	Foot, Capital, Dog	radical, radical, radical	Kick	Kick		しゅう	<reading>け</reading>			け	しゅう								In the <radical>foot</radical> <radical>capital</radical>, it's tough to be a <radical>dog</radical> because you're always getting <kanji>kick</kanji>ed. 	In the foot capital, you can only use your feet. So petting dogs looks a lot like kicking them.	When you <kanji>kick</kanji> a dog, there's an explosion of <reading><ja>毛</ja></reading> (<ja>け</ja>).	People in the foot capital are very kick-happy, so you can imagine how much <ja>毛</ja> is in the streets. 		7395	-	kanji Lesson_49
駒	Kanji	馬, 句	Horse, Paragraph	radical, radical	Chess Piece	Chess Piece		く	<reading>こま</reading>			こま	く								The <radical>horse</radical> who can write a <radical>paragraph</radical> gets to be a <kanji>chess piece</kanji>. Only the most erudite of horses gets selected to be a chess piece. The knight’s chess piece is represented by a horse, and for a horse to earn this honor, they must first write a paragraph explaining why they deserve the honor.	Imagine a horse trying to write a paragraph about why it deserves to be a chess piece. See the horse struggle with his hooves to write out a paragraph as he neighs in nervous frustration.	Upon being told that he will never be a <kanji>chess piece</kanji>, the horse slips into a <reading>coma</reading> (<ja>こま</ja>). The horse will never awaken from this coma as he knows he will never fulfill his dream of becoming a chess piece, so he has nothing to live for.	See this horse in its coma. You feel bad that it will never be able to be a chess piece, but this is a bit dramatic.		7396	-	kanji Lesson_49
紫	Kanji	止, 匕, 糸	Stop, Spoon, Thread	radical, radical, radical	Purple	Purple		<reading>し</reading>	むらさき			し	むらさき								You <radical>stop</radical> a <radical>spoon</radical> from moving by tying it with <radical>thread</radical> that's <kanji>purple</kanji>. The spoon wouldn't stop moving around, so you had to use your favorite purple thread to make it stop. It's the strongest thread you have.	Imagine tying this spoon down with thread that's a color other than purple. Ah, the thread snaps. Darn, you better use your extra strong purple thread (the best color for strength!).	You have to use all of your purple thread, and now you need more. You go into the back yard and call over your <kanji>purple</kanji> <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>).	Oh, did you think purple things were made with dye? No no, purple is a special color. You have to find unique purple sheep to make purple thread and clothes.		7397	-	kanji Lesson_49
抽	Kanji	扌, 由	Fingers, Reason	radical, radical	Pluck	Pluck		<reading>ちゅう</reading>				ちゅう									Your <radical>fingers</radical> give you a good <radical>reason</radical> to <kanji>pluck</kanji> things. You pluck flowers out of the ground. You pluck a cat out of a tree. Why? Because you have fingers! That's your reason.	Imagine using your fingers to pluck grapes and apples and other things, maybe non-fruit things.	Now that you have a reason to <kanji>pluck</kanji> things (you have fingers, after all) you decide you want to pluck all the fur off of <reading>Chew</reading>bacca (<ja>ちゅう</ja>). He is very furry, and you want to know what he looks like under there.	What reason could you have for wanting to pluck the fur off Chewbacca? Because you have fingers!

誓	Kanji	扌, 斤, 言	Fingers, Axe, Say	radical, radical, radical	Vow	Vow		<reading>せい</reading>	ちか			せい	ちか								With your <radical>fingers</radical> under an <radical>axe</radical>, you <radical>say</radical> a <kanji>vow</kanji>. A vow is a sacred promise, so you have to be really serious when you say one. That's why you do it with an axe hovering above your fingers—it's a reminder that if you break this vow your fingers are gonna get chopped off.	Picture the axe hovering above your fingers. Now say the vow. But don't lie. The axe knows when you're lying.	When you finish your <kanji>vow</kanji>, you take out your holy blue <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) and cut the axe in half! You know you're never going to break your vow, and if you do, you'll use your own saber to cut off your fingers.	Imagine what it would be like to slice off your own fingers with the saber you've carried for so long. You better not break that vow. 		7399	-	kanji Lesson_49

You can easily comprehend what each of those souls belonging to those mouths wants and feels deep down.	Imagine being able to comprehend everything about not one, but five other people. Deep down you can feel everything they think and feel.	Your <kanji>comprehension</kanji> is the strongest with the fifth mouth, belonging to <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>). You finally get why he wants to destroy buildings and cities.	Your comprehension of Godzilla reveals so much: he's warning the Japanese people about the use of new technology and warfare and experimentation. He just wants everyone to be able to comprehend these new, seemingly incomprehensible things!		7400	-	kanji Lesson_49
拓	Kanji	扌, 石	Fingers, Stone	radical, radical	Cultivation	Cultivation		<reading>たく</reading>				たく									You use your <radical>fingers</radical> and a <radical>stone</radical> to begin <kanji>cultivation</kanji> of the land. You use your fingers to till the soil, the stone to flatten the ground, and you carefully poke the seeds into the dirt and then use the stone to smash them further down.	Imagine being in a field, using your fingers and a stone to cultivate the whole thing, by hand.	<kanji>Cultivation</kanji> is suddenly halted because a <reading>tack</reading> (<ja>たく</ja>) sticks into your finger. You pull the tack out, throw it away and start cultivation again when... ouch! There's another tack. This field is full of tacks!	Now cultivation is going to involve getting all the tacks out of here, preferably with the stone and not your fingers, so they don't get stuck anymore.		7401	-	kanji Lesson_49
拘	Kanji	扌, 句	Fingers, Paragraph	radical, radical	Arrest	Arrest		<reading>こう</reading>	かか			こう	かか								You run your <radical>fingers</radical> along the words of a  <radical>paragraph</radical>. You are learning about the law because you plan to <kanji>arrest</kanji> somebody.	Imagine reading the paragraph very slowly. You find your answer. It looks like you'll be able to arrest that person...	Who do you want to <kanji>arrest</kanji>? You want to arrest <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>. Even though he's started wars, created a religion, and trapped a child in a cavity, it's going to be tricky to arrest him because he's the emperor now.	Still, according to this paragraph you're running your fingers through, you can do it. You can arrest <ja>こういち</ja>.		7402	-	kanji Lesson_49
礎	Kanji	石, 木, 疋	Stone, Tree, Coat Rack	radical, radical, radical	Foundation	Foundation		<reading>そ</reading>	いしずえ			そ	いしずえ								There’s a <radical>stone</radical>, a <radical>tree</radical>, another <radical>tree</radical>, and a <radical>coat rack</radical>. That stone and two trees will make the perfect <kanji>foundation</kanji> for a house to put that coat rack in! This stone is flat and heavy and both of the trees are flexible and durable.	Imagine making a foundation with the stone and the two trees so you’ll have a place for your coat rack. Feel the wood grain and cold stone against your skin as you move them around to form the foundation.	After you finish the <kanji>foundation</kanji>, the only step that's left is to wash the entire thing with <reading>so</reading>ap (<ja>そ</ja>).	Imagine getting on your hands and knees, rubbing a bar of soap all over the foundation you built. The soap gets into all the nooks and crannies in the wood and stone. Now if a coat falls off the coat rack onto the floor, you just add water and poof! Clean!		7403	-	kanji Lesson_49
鶴	Kanji	宀, 隹, 鳥	Roof, Turkey, Bird	radical, radical, radical	Crane	Crane		かく	<reading>つる</reading>			つる	かく								On the <radical>roof</radical> there's some type of <radical>turkey</radical> <radical>bird</radical>, but thinner and longer. You look closer and realize it's a <kanji>crane</kanji>.	Picture the beautiful black and white crane dancing gracefully on the roof. Now that you know what it is, you feel a little bad about calling it a turkey bird.	"The <kanji>crane</kanji> leans down toward you from its roof perch and squawks, ""<reading>Too ru</reading>de (<ja>つる</ja>)!"" You're shocked! You didn't know the crane could speak English, but even worse, it knew you called it a turkey bird."	The crane keeps saying you're too rude whenever other people come close so they know what kind of person you are. Yikes, you really shouldn't have gotten on this crane's bad side.		7404	-	kanji Lesson_49
刈	Kanji	メ, 刂	Treasure, Knife	radical, radical	Prune	Prune			<reading>か</reading>			か									Take your greatest <radical>treasure</radical>, hold a <radical>knife</radical> nice and close to it, and <kanji>prune</kanji> away all the weak and dead bits.	All treasures need to be taken care of, no matter what they are. Prune away anything that isn't necessary.	Currently, you want to <kanji>prune</kanji> your greatest treasure: your <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>). Your car is made of wood, and it keeps trying to grow new buds and branches, so you have to prune them off.	You want your car to be small and sleek, not a giant truck, so you have to carefully prune it when it grows too much.		7405	-	kanji Lesson_49
剛	Kanji	岡, 刂	Hill, Knife	radical, radical	Sturdy	Sturdy		<reading>ごう</reading>				ごう									A <radical>hill</radical> <radical>knife</radical> is the most <kanji>sturdy</kanji> knife you can find.	The reason hill knives are so sturdy is because they are shaped like hills. Very wide, very thick, not so long. So, they don't break and are more sturdy.	This <kanji>sturdy</kanji> (but strangely shaped) knife is used by <ja><reading>ごう</reading>いち</ja>. 	"Imagine <ja>ごういち</ja> rolling the knife back and forth over various things to cut them.

It’s very unique, so that mouth could belong to no other turkey but him. That mouth is solely his.	Imagine what makes this turkey’s mouth so unique. This beak is solely his. It belongs to no other. This turkey is the only turkey with a mouth like his.	You traveled a long way to see this turkey and the mouth that is <kanji>solely</kanji> his but you missed your exit on the highway and you have to hang a <reading>U-ey</reading> (<ja>ゆい</ja>). You know what hang a U-ey means, right? It’s making a U-turn. Well, you have to hang a U-ey on the highway so you can get off at the right spot to see this turkey and the mouth that is solely his.	Imagine hanging a U-ey on the highway. Hear your tires screech as you turn around and get off where you’re supposed to.		7407	-	kanji Lesson_49

You walk over and pull the lid off and the whole thing transforms into a <kanji>podium</kanji>. A podium for the dawn to tell you how many times it's risen over this dirt over and over again. It just keeps going and you realize the lid was here because this dang podium can't seem to keep a lid on it! (Get it? Figure of speech!)	This kanji also just... really looks like a podium right? With a guy wearing a graduation cap, pointing toward you, in the crowd.	"You listen to what the <kanji>podium</kanji> has to say for so long you finally can't help but ask, ""Who are you?"" ""I'm the <reading>dawn</reading> (<ja>だん</ja>), of course!"" And this is my podium where I spread the good news about the dawn!"	I guess that makes sense.

You give her this flag and this spoon because they are very precious to you and you want to show the nun how serious you are about repenting for your evil deeds.	Imagine handing the nun your country’s flag. And also a spoon that is very valuable to you. Imagine getting down on one knee as you do so.	You’re getting down on one <reading>knee</reading> (<ja>に</ja>) as you present the flag and the spoon to the <kanji>nun</kanji>. The nun accepts your offer and takes your flag and spoon from you.

It won't be exact, this isn't scientific or anything, but it will be pretty close.	Once you have an approximation on the age, you'll be able to come up with an approximation on how much it's worth too.	As you're recording your <kanji>approximation</kanji> down,  somebody comes up and shouts, “Hey <reading>guy</reading> (<ja>がい</ja>)! I’ll give you $10,000 for that tree there, guy!” This guy must be crazy. That’s much more than your approximation of the value of this thing. But you sell it to the guy anyway.

You will become immersed in the tsunami after it hits because tsunamis are gigantic and bring a lot of water. Now you and your forehead are immersed in the tsunami along with Wolverine and a stool.	Feel the water all around you as you become immersed in this tsunami. See Wolverine trying to swim his way to the top as you watch the stool floating about in the water.	Still <kanji>immersed</kanji>, the stool floats over and hits you in the <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>). The tsunami gave the stool a good push and while it was fully immersed, it ran into your shin. It really hurts.	Hear the stool crack against your shin and feel the pain erupt through your leg.

You go to see if you can find any remainder of the fire + tsunami battle. You can, but it's so faint.	Just like the tsunami and fire canceling each other out, leaving a <kanji>faint</kanji> remainder of what was, your <reading>tan</reading> (<ja>たん</ja>) is extremely faint as well.	Look at your skin.
