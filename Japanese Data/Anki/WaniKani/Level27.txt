Since you’re in a cage, you actually fashioned this comb yourself, so it’s a little messed up, missing a prong. You’re working on improving it in your spare time, and you also use it to style your mop.	Imagine yourself in your spare time, sitting on this stool in a cage in the sun. Feel the warmth of the sun on your body and feel the metal bars of the cage holding you in. You try to forget about your situation by combing your hair with the comb. The comb radical is a little modified, so be sure to remember that you made this comb yourself and it’s a little wonky.	So how did you get in this cage? Well, before you used to comb your hair in your <kanji>spare time</kanji>, you used to steal <reading>ca</reading>rs (<ja>か</ja>).

This drunkard is actually a <reading>Sheikh</reading> (<ja>しき</ja>) (an Arabic leader), but he’s just fallen on hard times and has been hitting the bottle pretty hard lately.

You want your friend to <kanji>lend</kanji> you some money so you can buy yourself a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>).

This dog used to live in the country, but he kept getting caught in bear and fox traps which busted the poor dog up. The dog didn’t want to live like this, so he decided to settle in the capital city where there aren’t pesky animal traps to get caught in.	Imagine this dog going to the capital and settling in. The poor dog looks pretty messed up though. The radical for dog in this kanji is a bit modified, so just remember that the dog in this story is all messed up.	In order to help the dog <kanji>settle in</kanji>, the capital cobbler makes him a pair of <reading>shoe</reading>s (<ja>しゅう</ja>). The shoes help him walk on his hurt legs, but more importantly, they help him relax and feel like a dog again.	Watch the broken dog settle in to his new shoes in his new home in the capital.

Feel the air whoosh past your face as you shoot off the end of the long slide and ascend into the air. It's starting to get hot and the sun is getting closer!	You need to <kanji>ascend</kanji> into the sky and toward the sun because the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) said so.

You are one of these peoples, so imagine yourself closing your eyes and sleeping. Go ahead and do it right now. Close one eye, and then the other. Now imagine yourself sleeping.	The reason you want to <kanji>sleep</kanji> is because all the other peoples were <reading>mean</reading> (<ja>みん</ja>) to you.

Feel yourself getting drowsy as you drive this goofy car. You’re so tired. Struggle to keep your eyes open. Also visualize this car missing its top and its bottom because the car radical is modified.	The reason you’re so <kanji>drowsy</kanji>, and also the reason your car is missing part of its bottom, is because you took one of the car’s tires and made a tire <reading>swi</reading>ng (<ja>すい</ja>) out of it.

You need to figure out the <kanji>symptom</kanji>s the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) is having. This is really serious too, so you better be correct about which sickness he has. If something bad happens to the Shougun it will be off with your head.	You get all up close and personal with the Shougun.

You <kanji>tighten</kanji> your towel before you eat <reading>ta</reading>ter (<ja>てい</ja>) tots every night.
