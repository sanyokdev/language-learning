Feel the grass in your toes and the fins in your hand as you raise them up to the sky. See the sun glistening off the fins as you raise them up in the air.	This ritual only works in one part of the world however. It absolutely must be performed in Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょ</ja>). The way Little Kyoto lines up with the sun and the sky and all that astrological junk makes it the best place for you to <kanji>raise</kanji> fish fins up in the air.

The world has been in turmoil and the public has been suffering, but it's time to stop splitting our hearts apart and fighting. It's time to be whole again.	Once their hearts are <kanji>whole</kanji>, the public's <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>) becomes one!	Suddenly people who were fighting for years are crying and holding one another.

Picture this lion on his hind legs, walking through a rice field. He’s holding an axe in one hand and acting like a human. See him cut off the plants and hear the whoosh of the axe as he cuts.	The lion will <kanji>cut off</kanji> rice stalks until <reading>dawn</reading> (<ja>だん</ja>). But at the first light of dawn, it will run and hide in the shade of the trees, cut off from the rice.

Some criticism is okay, as long as it's constructive and it helps the person get better. But when you start pointing fingers, it's time to step back and try to not be such a jerk.	If you're having trouble not giving out <kanji>criticism</kanji>, just think about how you would react if someone criticized you. You'd feel an embarrassed <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>) rise throughout your body. That heat will cover your whole face.	Before you throw criticism around, imagine that embarrassed heat.

The clause states that it cannot be a tree in the summer, because that is the summer tree's territory. Same goes for autumn and spring trees.

This <kanji>clause</kanji> was written into all trees' contracts by <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>), the large farmhand. 	Jourm noticed that the trees were getting too crowded, so he wrote up these clauses and added them to the trees' contracts. Now, the forests are less crowded, thanks to the little clause.
