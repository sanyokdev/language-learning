匕	Radical				Spoon	Spoon															This radical looks like a <radical>spoon</radical>! Well, a spoon that's been bent a lot by an angry person or a psychic. Go grab a spoon and try to bend it into this shape. Then hold on to it so you'll never forget that this is the spoon radical!					236	-	Lesson_3 radical
夂	Radical				Winter	Winter															This looks kind of like a footprint, but not an ordinary, old footprint. A snowshoe footprint in the snow. Why? Because it's <radical>winter</radical>! And everyone knows the snowshoe footprint is the universal symbol for winter.					237	-	Lesson_3 radical
干	Radical				Dry	Dry, Antenna															You have two on a stick. Two what? Well, you can't tell because they're too <radical>dry</radical>. Someone put two somethings on this stick to dry, but they seem to have left them out for way too long. Was it meat? Fish? Cucumbers? You have no clue, but they're two very dry somethings, that's for sure.					238	-	Lesson_3 radical
广	Radical				Canopy	Canopy, Mullet															This is a <radical>canopy</radical>. See the cloth draping down and the little point at the middle holding it up? You could sit under here and enjoy a bright, summer day without getting any sun!					239	-	Lesson_3 radical
扌	Radical				Fingers	Fingers, Nailbat															This looks like the hand (<ja>手</ja>) radical, but smaller. That's because it's just the <radical>fingers</radical>. You don't always have room for a whole hand to be in a kanji, but there's always space for a few fingers.					240	-	Lesson_3 radical
元	Radical				Origin	Origin															You have two legs making up this radical. Between two legs is where you came from, no matter how you look at it. These two legs are your <radical>origin</radical>.					241	-	Lesson_3 radical
心	Radical				Heart	Heart															Take a good look at this one. It kind of looks like a <radical>heart</radical> (not the stereotypical Valentine’s Day heart, though). Think of a real heart. Basically, there’s a lump (the heart) in the middle, and three lines which make up the arteries that go in and out of the heart to keep you alive. This radical shows up a lot, so it shouldn’t be too hard to learn it as you go along. Remember, lump (heart) plus arteries equals a heart… like, a real heart, not the fake, pretty kind.					242	-	Lesson_3 radical
方	Radical				Direction	Direction															This radical looks like a dude running off to the right. He's heading in a very distinct <radical>direction</radical>. Which direction was it again?					243	-	Lesson_3 radical
毛	Radical				Fur	Fur															Do you remember the hair radical? This is like that, except now the hair is attached to a tail. Animals don't usually have hair, though. Instead, they have <radical>fur</radical>.					244	-	Lesson_3 radical
父	Radical				Father	Father, Dad															"There are fins covering the treasure making up this radical. You pull away the fins and start digging where the X is (because ""X"" marks where the treasure is, right?). When you dig down, instead of finding treasure, you find your <radical>father</radical>. The shock of this in your imagination should help you to remember the meaning of this radical!"					245	-	Lesson_3 radical
古	Radical				Old	Old															"You have a cross on a mouth—that's a pretty religious mouth. Who speaks the most about religion? <radical>Old</radical> people, mostly. Also, think about the teachings of religion itself - also pretty old, age-wise. No matter how you look at it, everything about this radical is kind of ""old."""					246	-	Lesson_3 radical
用	Radical				Task	Task, Elephant															This looks a bit like a calendar with spaces for you to write in your <radical>task</radical>s for the day. See those blank sections? Make sure you write down your daily tasks, so you don't forget to do something important!					247	-	Lesson_3 radical
矢	Radical				Arrow	Arrow															You have a really big gun. Why? Because only big guns will be able to shoot <radical>arrow</radical>s! Bullets are pretty small, so the guns that shoot them can be any size. But you need a big gun if you want to shove an arrow in it and then shoot it at your enemies.					248	-	Lesson_3 radical
戸	Radical				Door	Door															Where does a flag usually go? It goes over a <radical>door</radical>. I know the <ja>一</ja> radical usually means ground, but in this case we're going to say the flag is in the doorway (where the <ja>一</ja> is the top of the door).					249	-	Lesson_3 radical
幺	Radical				Poop	Poop															"There's something sticking out of you while you're in private. It's <radical>poop</radical>! You can't just poop in public, that's illegal and gross in this day and age. So the next time something starts to come out of you when you're in private, think, ""Ah yes, it's poop."""					250	-	Lesson_3 radical
巾	Radical				Towel	Towel, Two Face															There's something draped over that stick. It's a <radical>towel!</radical>! Imagine taking a wet towel and hanging it over a railing or a stick so it won't get all musty and gross. It would look just like this.					251	-	Lesson_3 radical
生	Radical				Life	Life															"This radical consists of a cow radical with the ground radical below it. If you have cows on solid ground, then you really do have a good <radical>life</radical>, I think. Sometimes this radical will show up without the slide part on the side too, though we'll treat them both as ""life."""					252	-	Lesson_3 radical
今	Radical				Now	Now															"This is a hat on top of the katakana for ""ra."" Think of Ra, the Egyptian god. When is Ra wearing a hat? Right <radical>now</radical>! It's always now, because he never takes it off. No really, look it up, it's true."					253	-	Lesson_3 radical
<i class=radical-hat></i>	Radical				Hat	Hat															Do you know those rice paddy hats? The ones shaped just like this radical? That's why this radical is a <radical>hat</radical>.					254	-	Lesson_3 radical
<i class=radical-triceratops></i>	Radical				Triceratops	Triceratops															The three horns represent the <radical>triceratops</radical>, one of the most awesome dinosaurs ever.					255	-	Lesson_3 radical
万	Kanji	<i class=radical-leaf></i>, 刀	Leaf, Sword	radical, radical	Ten Thousand	Ten Thousand, 10000, 10,000, 10 thousand		<reading>まん</reading> <reading>ばん</reading>				まん, ばん									You cut the <radical>leaf</radical> with your <radical>sword</radical> into <kanji>ten thousand</kanji> pieces!	If you can get to ten thousand different pieces, then that means your sword is absolutely perfect. If your sword dulls before you get to ten thousand, you have to throw it away.	Now that you have <kanji>ten thousand</kanji> pieces of tiny leaf paper, you decide to turn them into a <reading>man</reading>ga (<ja>まん</ja>)! Each little leaf piece will become a panel.	Carefully draw your manga onto these ten thousand leaf pieces. Maybe you even use your sword again to give them some textured details. You're so creative and talented!		256	-	kanji Lesson_3
今	Kanji	今	Now	radical	Now	Now		<reading>こん</reading>	いま			こん	いま								The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>now</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>now</kanji> as well.	Make sure you know those radicals, yo!	Right <kanji>now</kanji> the <reading>con</reading>dors (<ja>こん</ja>) are in danger! Not next week, not next year, right now! Haven't you heard that deforestation and pollution are killing all of the condors?!	Go outside right now and do something to save the condors. If you don't do something right now there won't be enough time left!		257	-	kanji Lesson_3
元	Kanji	元	Origin	radical	Origin	Origin		<reading>げん</reading> <reading>がん</reading>	もと			げん, がん	もと								The <radical>origin</radical> radical and the <kanji>origin</kanji> kanji are the same!	Know your radicals!	"The <kanji>origin</kanji> of everything can be found in <reading>Gen</reading>ji (<ja>げん</ja>). Genji is the name of the main character in the world's first ever novel, ""The Tale of Genji.""   Picture him as a rich, pretty boy who cares a ton about his looks and gets along really well with all the ladies. He's also really great at poetry, which helps the lady situation."	Genji's origin story is pretty important when it comes to mnemonics and Japanese literature. He's going to keep popping up on your kanji journey, so make sure you remember him!		258	-	kanji Lesson_3
公	Kanji	ハ, ム	Fins, Private	radical, radical	Public	Public		<reading>こう</reading>				こう									You have <radical>fins</radical> in <radical>private</radical>. But, you want the world to see them, so you take them <kanji>public</kanji>.	"Picture yourself in private, with fins. You wish others could see them. ""That's it,"" you decide. ""It's time to show the world. I'm going to make my fins public!"""	You head out into the <kanji>public</kanji> where everyone can see your fins, but... things have changed. All people are the same. There are thousands of <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>s walking around, and they all stare at you (though they pretend like they aren't).	Remember, whenever we see the reading <ja>こう</ja>, think of <ja>こういち</ja>, a founder of WaniKani. We'll keep it consistent, so over time you should develop a character around <ja>こういち</ja> that you learn to love or hate.  How long have you been hiding in private with your fins? The public areas have changed, and all the people have become <ja>こういち</ja>s. One mother <ja>こういち</ja>--pushing a baby <ja>こういち</ja>--looks up and stares at your fins. Now you remember why you never go out in public.		259	-	kanji Lesson_3
内	Kanji	冂, 人	Head, Person	radical, radical	Inside, Within	Inside, Within		<reading>ない</reading>	うち			ない	うち								There's a <radical>person</radical> <kanji>inside</kanji> your <radical>head</radical>.	And, you have no idea how to get them out. They're <kanji>inside</kanji> for good, and it's freaking you out. As in, there's a little person in there, running around, controlling your brain. People think you're crazy, but you know better... He's <kanji>inside</kanji> there, doing evil things.	You know this kanji means inside, so you can keep thinking about the person that’s inside you, running around. You finally discover him, and try to take him out, but before you can, he pulls out a <reading>kni</reading>fe (<ja>ない</ja>) and threatens to cut you if you do anything irrational.	Imagine him holding the knife out, threatening to stab your brain. You’re in a conundrum here. If you don’t take him out, you’re in trouble, but if you do try to take him out, he might stab you in the brain with his knife. Try to think a way around this situation, focusing mainly on his knife.		260	-	kanji Lesson_3
分	Kanji	ハ, 刀	Fins, Sword	radical, radical	Part, Minute, Separate, Understand	Part, Minute, Separate, Understand, Portion		<reading>ぶん</reading> <reading>ふん</reading> <reading>ぶ</reading>	わ			ぶん, ふん, ぶ	わ								The <radical>fins</radical> that fell onto my <radical>sword</radical> were sliced into two <kanji>parts</kanji>.	The logic of this story makes a lot of sense - even in the kanji itself the fins are falling onto the sword from above. What happens to things that fall onto swords? They become more than one <kanji>part</kanji>.	Now that you've cut the fish, it's time to cut something else into <kanji>parts</kanji>. Next on your list is the <reading>buns</reading> (<ja>ぶん</ja>) which need to be split up amongst the people. If you'd like to learn the second reading, just think about how <reading>fun</reading> (<ja>ふん</ja>) it will be to do this task.	Think about the <reading>buns</reading> (<ja>ぶん</ja>) as absolutely delicious things you want to eat really bad. If you want to eat the buns, and you taste the buns in your imagination, you'll surely remember that the reading for this kanji is <ja>ふん</ja> as well.		261	-	kanji Lesson_3
切	Kanji	七, 刀	Seven, Sword	radical, radical	Cut	Cut		<reading>せつ</reading>	き			せつ	き								If you have <radical>seven</radical> <radical>swords</radical>, there's only so much you can do with them. The main thing? Probably using them to <kanji>cut</kanji> something.	Take these seven swords and swing them around. <kanji>Cut</kanji> everything in your path, including yourself. Then, think about how dumb it was to try to use seven swords at once, and then feel the pain of the cut you gave yourself. Ouch, ouch ouch.	Because having seven swords for yourself is too much, you decide to take the swords and divide them up amongst pairs of people. You <kanji>cut</kanji> them into pairs, and give <reading>sets</reading> (<ja>せつ</ja>) to everyone who needs them in the village.	Just make sure you think about how you need to give them away in <reading>sets</reading>, and not anything else. This is the most important thing to think about in your head as you're trying to establish the mnemonic for your kanji reading memory. It's gotta be sets.		262	-	kanji Lesson_3
午	Kanji	丿, 干	Slide, Dry	radical, radical	Noon	Noon		<reading>ご</reading>				ご									The <radical>slide</radical> is <radical>dry</radical> at <kanji>noon</kanji>. The sun is brightest at noon, so it dries the morning dew off the slide, making noon the perfect time to slide.	Picture all the kids out sliding on the slide at noon during their lunch break. It's hot and dry and they're very happy.	<kanji>Noon</kanji> also happens to be the time <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>) decided to attack for the same reasons: it's dry and kids are using the slide.	Watch in horror as Godzilla's giant foot crushes all the kids and their slide at exactly noon. You'd better go...		263	-	kanji Lesson_3
友	Kanji	ナ, 又	Narwhal, Stool	radical, radical	Friend	Friend		<reading>ゆう</reading>	とも			ゆう	とも								A <radical>narwhal</radical> sitting on a <radical>stool</radical> is your <kanji>friend</kanji>.	"Imagine that narwhal sitting there. It waves its flipper and says ""hi friend"" to you."	"""Hi <kanji>friend</kanji>,"" says the narwhal. ""I must warn you about all the <reading>you</reading>ths."" (<ja>ゆう</ja>)"	Your narwhal friend goes on to warn you about all those youths, and how they will try to take away your friendship with their good looks and young ages.		264	-	kanji Lesson_3
太	Kanji	大, 丶	Big, Drop	radical, radical	Fat	Fat		<reading>たい</reading> <reading>た</reading>	ふと	おお		たい, た	ふと, おお								You have a <radical>big</radical> guy here, with an extra <radical>drop</radical> of something below his thigh, hanging down. That's <kanji>fat</kanji> right there. He's so fat he has things of fat hanging off his fat.	"Maybe you should touch the <kanji>fat</kanji> below his leg just to see what it is... feel it, and squeeze it. It'll help you to remember that this kanji means ""fat."""	This poor <kanji>fat</kanji> guy has trouble with a lot of things. One of the things he has the most trouble with is tying a <reading>tie</reading> (<ja>たい</ja>).	Imagine him trying to tie the <reading>tie</reading> but he can't lift his hands around to do it. You have to help him out. Another thing that might help you to remember this kanji's reading is that it's the same reading as <ja>大</ja> (or, one of the same readings). Similar kanji often have similar readings, which is a good thing to know when you have to guess (it's true with this one, anyways!).		265	-	kanji Lesson_3
少	Kanji	小, 丿	Small, Slide	radical, radical	Few, A Little	Few, A Little, A Few		<reading>しょう</reading>	すこ すく			しょう	すこ, すく								You have a <radical>small</radical> <radical>slide</radical>. The thing about small slides is that they can only fit a <kanji>few</kanji> people at a time.	Imagine a small slide (how could you not, after you see the radicals?) with only a few people on it, trying to move forward. Only a few people are required to create a slide traffic jam, though. :(	Why is there <kanji>a little</kanji> traffic jam on the slide? Because the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) is using the slide and he loves little things. He's forcing everyone to stop and watch, even though there are people backed up behind him. How inconsiderate.	Imagine this in your head. A traffic jam on a little slide, all because the shogun is using it. Picture some caution tape, orange cones, and Japanese secret service members all making sure no one gets close to the shougun while he slides. A few people are crying. They want to slide, they want to leave.		266	-	kanji Lesson_3
引	Kanji	弓, <i class=radical-stick></i>	Bow, Stick	radical, radical	Pull	Pull		いん	<reading>ひ</reading>			ひ	いん								If you have a <radical>bow</radical> and a <radical>stick</radical> you need to <kanji>pull</kanji> the two back together to shoot it. If you can't pull it, you won't be shooting anything.	Imagine taking a stick and pulling it back into your bow. Imagine how hard you have to pull. This thing is really strong! 	When you <kanji>pull</kanji> the bow back, your body strains and you feel an immense <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>) rise inside of you. You keep pulling and the heat grows hotter and hotter.	Imagine using all your strength to pull on this bow. Imagine the heat rising in your body. There's sweat dripping down your face. It's so hot, but you have to keep pulling!		267	-	kanji Lesson_3
心	Kanji	心	Heart	radical	Heart	Heart		<reading>しん</reading>	こころ			しん	こころ								The radical <radical>heart</radical> and the kanji <kanji>heart</kanji> are the same. Rejoice and let your heart be free!	Also, make sure you know the radicals by heart, it'll help you to learn more effectively, just like with this kanji.	The <kanji>heart</kanji>, where is it stored in your body? Most people thought it was in the chest, but in reality, your <kanji>heart</kanji> is stored in your <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>).	This is when I start kicking you in the shin and you imagine feeling the pain of getting kicked there. As I kick you in the shin, you grab your chest... all this stress is giving you a heart attack (though your shin hurts a ton too).		268	-	kanji Lesson_3
戸	Kanji	戸	Door	radical	Door	Door		こ	<reading>と</reading>			と	こ								The radical and the kanji for <kanji>door</kanji> are the same!	Time to open the door to the reading part of this mnemonic.	You open the <kanji>door</kanji> and immediately get it closed back on your <reading>toe</reading> (<ja>と</ja>), literally causing your toe to explode. 	Feel the pain of your toe going away. Think about the other side of the <kanji>door</kanji>, where your <reading>toe</reading> is probably rolling around after it blasted off your foot.		269	-	kanji Lesson_3
方	Kanji	方	Direction	radical	Direction, Way	Direction, Way		<reading>ほう</reading>	かた			ほう	かた								"The radical and the kanji for <kanji>direction</kanji> are the same! Huzzah!  There is also another meaning too, though. This can also mean <kanji>way</kanji> as well. Think of it this way: When you move in one direction in your life, you are developing your own way. ""The way of [your name here]."""	The only direction you need to go in is forward, it's always the right way.	What <kanji>direction</kanji> do you always know? Which direction do you always want to go? <reading>Ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>). Something about your home always stays with you, no matter how far away you go. So if you're lost and you don't know which direction to go, just think of home!	Close your eyes and picture your home in your mind. Can you tell which direction it is from where you are?		270	-	kanji Lesson_3
牛	Kanji	牛	Cow	radical	Cow	Cow		<reading>ぎゅう</reading>	うし			ぎゅう	うし								The radical and the kanji for <kanji>cow</kanji> are exactly the same! That makes it easy to remember, so long as you know your radicals well enough.	The radicals are important to know, so make sure you're studying them. They'll come back again, you know!	Have you ever heard of <ja>わ<reading>ぎゅう</reading></ja> beef? That <ja>ぎゅう</ja> is this <ja>ぎゅう</ja>.

No, I am not your father... but this kanji / radical set is!	Imagine your father is <reading>Cheech</reading> (<ja>ちち</ja>) from Cheech and Chong.	Hopefully you know who they are.

毛	Kanji	毛	Fur	radical	Fur, Hair	Fur, Hair		<reading>もう</reading>	け			もう	け								<kanji>Fur</kanji> and <radical>fur</radical> are the same as each other, so the meaning of this kanji should be simple. This can also mean <kanji>hair</kanji>, too, though more like furry hair.	Just make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise it won't be as simple as I'd hoped.	With <kanji>fur</kanji>, wisp your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it’s fur). You’re surrounded by the black fur, the wind is blowing. Imagine yourself touching the long fur and smelling it. What does it feel / smell like? Now it’s time to get rid of it. There’s just too much <kanji>hair</kanji>! To get rid of it, you’ll need to <reading>mow</reading> (<ja>もう</ja>) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they’re loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think “fur → In the fur → getting rid of the fur → mow the fur,” in that order. That’ll get you to mow, which will help you to remember the on’yomi.	Smell the <kanji>fur</kanji> as you <reading>mow</reading> it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better.		273	-	kanji Lesson_3
止	Kanji	止	Stop	radical	Stop	Stop		<reading>し</reading>	と や			し	と, や								The <radical>stop</radical> radical is the same as the <kanji>stop</kanji> kanji.	Know your radicals, yo!	You have to <kanji>stop</kanji> because there is a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) in front of you. You try to walk around the sheep, but it moves to stop in front of you again. Every time the sheep stops you stop too.	Imagine the fluffy wool of the sheep, stopping you from moving forward. You can't push past it, no matter how hard you try.		274	-	kanji Lesson_3
冬	Kanji	夂, 二	Winter, Two	radical, radical	Winter	Winter		とう	<reading>ふゆ</reading>			ふゆ	とう								We have the <radical>winter</radical> radical and the <radical>two</radical> radical (though it's sort of slanted). What's two times the winter radical, if radicals are just a part of a kanji? Two times would be enough to create the entire kanji, which is also <kanji>winter</kanji>.	"You could also think, ""Winter too"" instead of ""two."" Because, this kanji is in fact ""<kanji>winter</kanji> too."""	"<kanji>Winter</kanji> is the time of year you give out presents: ""one fo' you, one fo'you. And... not you, this one's not fo' you so <reading>fu’ you!</reading> (<ja>ふゆ</ja>)!"	Note, be careful: this kanji is a little different from the radical <ja>夂</ja> though has the same meaning… but don’t let that <reading>fool you</reading> (<ja>ふゆ</ja>).		275	-	kanji Lesson_3

The spoon is like a compass needle and your fingers guide the knowledge your body already has and uses it to point north. That's science, friends!  Notice how the fingers radical is a little different here? That's because you're pointing them really hard.	Imagine taking a spoon and balancing it on your fingers. Now watch the spoon spin spin spin until it stops and ultimately points north.	You realize that this ability to find <kanji>north</kanji> is probably really valuable, so you go to the nearest pawn shop and <reading>hock</reading> (<ja>ほく</ja>) it. Even your fingers.	Imagine walking out of a pawn shop after hocking your fingers and spoon and realizing that you don't know where you are. Oh, if only you could tell where north was...		276	-	kanji Lesson_3

But it's so big, and it's laying on its side, so only <kanji>half</kanji> of it gets dry.	Imagine the triceratops on its side, then imagine it getting up. When it stands up normally, half of its body is soaking wet still. It's a half-n-half triceratops right now.	"""You're half wet and half dry! I will cut you in <kanji>half</kanji> with my laser blaster so you're proper again,"" a voice says.

Make sure you know those radicals, yo!	<kanji>Old</kanji> things are misunderstood by the <ja><reading>子</reading></ja>s (<ja>こ</ja>) of the world.  *Note:* Come up with a <ja>子</ja> character you can use for all the <ja>こ</ja> reading mnemonics going forward. This child will show up many times throughout your mnemonic journey, and it will help if you imagine the same character the whole time.	Imagine a <ja>子</ja> looking at old things. A record player.

To make sure they can't tell what's <kanji>machine</kanji> and what's human, you <reading>dye</reading> (<ja>だい</ja>) the mouth to make it look like skin. You find dye the same shade as your normal mouth and just slap it on there.

Often times when two kanji come together to form a combo kanji you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. So, the reading of <ja>人</ja> is the on'yomi reading <ja>じん</ja>, which you learned already in the kanji. This pattern works with almost any location as well.
