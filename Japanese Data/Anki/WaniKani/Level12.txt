I’m sure you’ve heard many theories on how dinosaurs went extinct. Well, this is the real story. Imagine this poor triceratops and all his friends being extinguished by this powerful tsunami, sweeping them up into the moon where there's no air to breathe or leaves to eat.	This famous event where almost all life was <kanji>extinguish</kanji>ed is reenacted every year for the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>). He's got a bit of an unhealthy obsession with extinguishing life...	Watch the Shougun's eyes light up as an actor dressed like a tsunami crashes into an actor dressed as a triceratops and all of the lights on the stage are extinguished. Spooky...		1814	-	kanji Lesson_12
倍	Kanji	ｲ, 咅	Leader, Clown	radical, radical	Double, Times, Multiply	Double, Times, Multiply		<reading>ばい</reading>				ばい									"A <radical>leader</radical> who hires his own personal <radical>clown</radical> will likely <kanji>double</kanji> his entertainment. Clowns are funny and make people laugh, so the leader decided to hire one. Since that time, the leader’s amount of mirth has doubled.   This also means <kanji>times</kanji>, which makes sense when you think about the kind of math you'll need to double something. What is A * 2? It's A doubled, first of all, but you're using multiplication. You're ""timesing"" something."	Picture a clown and all the ridiculous funny things they do. Imagine the clown throwing a pie at someone’s face and how funny that is. Chuckle to yourself and remember this kanji.	When the clown stops being funny, it’s time to say <reading>bye</reading> (<ja>ばい</ja>). At first, the clown <kanji>double</kanji>d the leader’s entertainment, but now the clown is just annoying. It’s time to say bye-bye.	This clown has served its purpose. Wave your hand in the air and say bye-bye to this worthless clown.		1815	-	kanji Lesson_12

Yes, shellfish do have mouths, look it up!	Imagine a shellfish opening and closing its mouth, talking to you and telling you what a proud member of its family it is. It’s a strange sight, but picture it in your mind anyway.	If you were a <kanji>member</kanji> of the same shellfish family, you'd be able to go to the special shellfish <reading>inn</reading> (<ja>いん</ja>). Every species has a members-only inn.	Imagine trying to go to the shellfish inn. Imagine all the members-only signs telling you that you can't come in. Womp womp.		1816	-	kanji Lesson_12
島	Kanji	鳥, 山	Bird, Mountain	radical, radical	Island	Island		とう	<reading>しま</reading>			しま	とう								A <radical>bird</radical> sits upon a <radical>mountain</radical>. If you look at the radicals, the bird is quite large and the mountain quite small. Think of this in the mnemonic as well. The reason the mountain is small is because you can only see the top of it, sticking out of the water. On it is the bird. This small mountain with the bird on it is an <kanji>island</kanji>.	Imagine the mountain as small as you'd like. Maybe it's only barely sticking out of the sea, and the bird is having trouble standing on it. Whatever you do, make sure you think of it as an island, possibly owned by the bird.	But this <kanji>island</kanji> doesn't only belong to the bird. In fact, the bird shouldn't be on this island, because it belongs to <reading>She-Ma</reading>n (<ja>しま</ja>), He-Man's girlfriend. She-Man comes out of the water and grabs the bird, eats it, and then goes back into the sea from whence she came.	I don't think She-Man is a real character, but you can make up this imaginary He-Man girlfriend in your mind. She is weird about her island, and weird about eating birds, but He-Man and She-Man are in love, so why are you judging? Imagine the two having dinner on their small island later that evening. He-Man wonders where she got the bird from.		1817	-	kanji Lesson_12
祭	Kanji	癶, 示	Tent, Jackhammer	radical, radical	Festival	Festival		<reading>さい</reading>	まつり まつ			さい	まつり, まつ								You have a <radical>tent</radical> with a <radical>jackhammer</radical> in it for the <kanji>festival</kanji>! Festivals need booths where people can do activities. In this tent, festival goers can use a jackhammer and make a lot of noise, perfect for a festival!	Imagine being at a festival and waiting in line to ride the jackhammer. You don't want to eat candy apples or ride rides, you want to wait for the jackhammer tent.	This <kanji>festival</kanji> is for <reading>cy</reading>borgs (<ja>さい</ja>) only. Picture the cyborg you made getting excited that you're taking it to the festival. That's why all of the activities have to do with heavy machinery. The rides are mostly just cyborgs letting other people ride them, but it's still pretty fun.	Imagine your cyborg going to this festival. Everyone here has some type of cyborg enhancement, like robotic arms, legs, or braces. Your cyborg is really excited to be around its people and play with jackhammers.		1818	-	kanji Lesson_12
章	Kanji	立, 早	Stand, Early	radical, radical	Chapter	Chapter		<reading>しょう</reading>				しょう									You <radical>stand</radical> at a podium <radical>early</radical> in the morning to practice reading the <kanji>chapter</kanji> from your latest book.	"Picture yourself, standing tall in the light of the early morning. You hold your head up high, open to your bookmark, and read the name of the chapter aloud: ""Chapter 42: The Most Important Number."""	You're practicing this specific <kanji>chapter</kanji> because you've been asked to read it for the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>). There will be a bunch of other authors reading chapters of their books to him too, and you want to make a good impression.	Picture yourself in a line with other authors, standing in the early morning, waiting to read chapters from your respective books. You really hope the Shougun likes yours. If he does, you'll be famous! If he doesn't, you might be beheaded.		1819	-	kanji Lesson_12
第	Kanji	竹, 弟	Bamboo, Younger Brother	radical, radical	Ordinal Number Prefix, Ordinal Prefix, Number	Ordinal Number Prefix, Ordinal Prefix, Number		<reading>だい</reading>				だい									<radical>Bamboo</radical>'s <radical>younger brother</radical> is counted with an <kanji>ordinal number prefix</kanji>. An ordinal number is one that represents a position or rank in sequential order (like first, second, third, etc.). We use this ordinal number prefix before counting these things in Japanese sometimes. Like with bamboo, going down in order toward the youngest.	Imagine a line of bamboo shoots arranged from oldest to youngest. They look like pipe organ pipes, or a xylophone, and now you need to count them.	To remember you need to use the <kanji>ordinal number prefix</kanji> before you count these bamboo, you <reading>dye</reading> (<ja>だい</ja>) them.	Now they're in descending order already, and you can count them nice and easy thanks to your dye method.		1820	-	kanji Lesson_12

You don't know who they are, but now an absolute ton of other someones you don't know also live here in these buildings and work in this busy metropolis.	Imagine just how many different someones live in this metropolis. There are so many people, you'll never meet them all!	You try to picture the faces of all the people who live in this <kanji>metropolis</kanji>, but for some reason you can only picture their <reading>toe</reading>s (<ja>と</ja>). And there are ten times as many toes in this city than someones.	If you think about it, every metropolis is completely jam-packed-full of toes. Just picture it. Toes. Everywhere. In every building. Filling up the streets.		1821	-	kanji Lesson_12
動	Kanji	重, 力	Heavy, Power	radical, radical	Move	Move		<reading>どう</reading>	うご			どう	うご								When something is <radical>heavy</radical>, you need a lot of <radical>power</radical> to <kanji>move</kanji> it. It’s not going to move unless you use a lot of power. That thing is heavy and unless you use all the power you got, it’s not moving.	Picture a massive 1 ton weight. It’s heavy. You can’t even begin to move it without some sort of powerful machine to help you. Imagine yourself trying to move it with just your bare hands.	Remember that 1 ton weight? Well, actually it’s a <reading>dou</reading>ghnut (<ja>どう</ja>). A huge, massive, 1 ton doughnut. It’s super heavy and hard to move, but it’s delicious.	Okay, so you don’t have enough power to move this doughnut as is. In order to move it, you’re going to have to use your superhuman power of eating. Once you eat enough of it, the remainder will be easy to move. Imagine yourself digging into this massive doughnut and taste its fresh baked goodness on your tongue. It’s mighty tasty.		1822	-	kanji Lesson_12

Most mustaches can’t stand because they don’t have legs. This mustache, however, does. It also has a keen business sense, which is why it’s selling merchandise.	Imagine this mustache entrepreneur, standing at his merchandise stand, selling his wares. He looks quite dignified, legs and all.	The mustache is selling his <kanji>merchandise</kanji> so well that even the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) notices. He leans down really close to the standing mustache man's merchandise and stays very still. Then he snaps his fingers and his servants come rushing out to buy it all!	Now all of the merchandise belongs to the Shougun. The mustache has nothing left to sell, but at least he's rich!		1823	-	kanji Lesson_12

You don't want a bunch of evil in your heart, do you? No, I didn't think so.	Luckily, people in Asia know how to get the <kanji>evil</kanji> <kanji>bad</kanji>ness out of your heart with <reading>acu</reading>puncture (<ja>あく</ja>).	Acupuncture was originally invented in Asia a long, long time ago, to stop the bad chi from going through your heart.		1824	-	kanji Lesson_12
族	Kanji	方, <i class=radical-gun></i>, 矢	Direction, Gun, Arrow	radical, radical, radical	Tribe, Family	Tribe, Family		<reading>ぞく</reading>				ぞく									If someone with a <radical>gun</radical> is headed your <radical>direction</radical>, nock an <radical>arrow</radical> in your bow and gather your <kanji>tribe</kanji> behind you because it’s about to get real! This cretin with a gun is headed your direction and he doesn’t even know what you and your tribe are gonna do to him. If he gets any closer, you’re likely to shoot that arrow right at him.	This guy headed your direction with his gun doesn’t look friendly at all. Hear the sound of the bowstring as you nock your arrow and prepare your shot to defend yourself. Then imagine the sound of everyone in your tribe doing the same.	When he starts to get closer, you notice that this guy is a boso<reading>zoku</reading> (<ja>ぞく</ja>) bike gang member. Bosozoku means “running <kanji>tribe</kanji>” and this guy is running right at you. With a gun. So gather your own tribe behind you and prepare to defend yourself against this bosozoku member.	You remember what a bosozoku is, right? We wrote about them on Tofugu a while ago. They’re bike gang members and the “zoku” in bosozoku means tribe. Remember that article when you see this kanji.		1825	-	kanji Lesson_12
深	Kanji	氵, 兀, 木	Tsunami, Pi, Tree	radical, radical, radical	Deep	Deep		<reading>しん</reading>	ふか			しん	ふか								The force of a <radical>tsunami</radical> is enough to put a gash in a <radical>tree</radical> about <radical>pi</radical> (3.14) feet <kanji>deep</kanji>. Tsunamis are pretty powerful, so the force of the water alone is enough to cut into a tree several feet deep.	Picture this tsunami wave hitting the tree. It’s like a lumberjack axe of water, cutting deep into the tree with the force of a thousand lumberjacks.	Some tsunamis cut so <kanji>deep</kanji> that they flat out chop the tree right off its stump. In areas like this, you have to be careful not to bang a <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>) on them. These stumps are right about shin height, so you want to be cautious when walking around them as to not injure yourself.	Imagine being deep in the woods and banging your shin on a stump you didn’t see. It hurts to bang your shin, so imagine this pain and the awful sensation it brings.		1826	-	kanji Lesson_12
球	Kanji	王, 求	King, Request	radical, radical	Sphere, Ball	Sphere, Ball		<reading>きゅう</reading>	たま			きゅう	たま								The <radical>king</radical> <radical>request</radical>s a <kanji>sphere</kanji>! He didn't say what kind though, so you're going to have to figure it out and bring him the right kind of sphere.	Imagine all the different spheres you know and bring them to the king one by one. He doesn't seem to like any of them... think of more spheres!	"You can't seem to find the <kanji>sphere</kanji> the king requested, so you take a break, sit down, and take out your lunch. ""THAT!"" the king screams, ""THAT IS THE SPHERE I REQUESTED!"" You look down and he's pointing to the cut up <reading>cu</reading>cumbers (<ja>きゅう</ja>) in your salad."	Cucumbers aren't really spheres... they're circles at best if you cut them, but you can't tell the king that. Just let him eat your cucumbers and think they're sphere-shaped. Maybe next time use a melon-baller and make your cucumbers into spheres for him.		1827	-	kanji Lesson_12

They aren't babies, who crawl, and they aren't adults who sit in front of their computers all day. They're juveniles who stand.	Picture all of the juveniles standing in your village. You used to stand out there too and it was really boring, but at least kids these days have phones to keep them company.	Right now all of the <kanji>juvenile</kanji>s are standing in line to get <reading>dou</reading>ghnuts (<ja>どう</ja>). Free doughnuts, actually. Psh. Just like juveniles to get handouts, amirite?

Its warm light fills your entire body as it covers the building with ease.	Standing in <kanji>sunshine</kanji> for this long has worked up your appetite, so you take a <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>) cup out of your bag and eat it.

Each of those white parts is a <kanji>floor</kanji>. Multi-<kanji>story</kanji> buildings have tons of different floors that you can see from the outside.	All buildings have white marks that you can compare with the rest to see where the floors are. 	You need to use your ability to tell where <kanji>floor</kanji>s are from the outside of the building to find the <kanji>story</kanji> that lets <reading>ka</reading>yaks (<ja>かい</ja>) in. You're coming from the side of the building surrounded by water, so you need to find the kayak floor to get in.	Picture this building and each of its floors.

Inside the house is cold, outside the house is cold. Everything is cold!	Picture the entire roof covered in ice. It's supposed to be spring right now, but it's too cold for the ice to melt off your roof.	You can't stand the <kanji>cold</kanji> anymore, so you hire a <reading>samu</reading>rai to come try to hack the ice off of your roof with his sword. You stand outside shivering, and watching as the samurai tries to stab the ice off of your roof.	The samurai isn't doing a good job stopping the cold, and soon he and his sword have frozen into your ice roof. So now it's cold and you have a dead samurai stuck to your house.

"Imagine you are this someone, standing out in the hot sun. Feel the sun’s hot rays beating down on you as you stand outside. The hot sun makes you start to sweat and you get all sweaty and sticky from the heat. Note that this usually refers to the hot weather or the heat of an area you're in and doesn't refer to a hot ""thing."""	You need to get out of this <kanji>hot</kanji> sun and into some air conditioning. Then you remember there’s a great air conditioning unit <reading>at Su</reading>zie’s (<ja>あつ</ja>) house. Ah, Suzie – our savior! If you need me, I’ll be at Suzie’s place.	Imagine that great feeling when you go from hot and sticky outside to nice and air conditioned inside.

I’m sure you’ve seen movies where people go out in space with no spacesuit. Now imagine this happening to the poor crab. It only takes a small period of time for the dark reaches of space to kill him.	In order for this crab to live on the moon for any <kanji>period of time</kanji>, you’re going to need to put him in a special moon aquarium and lock the lid with a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). This crab is crafty, so after you lock it, take the key with you and don’t let it out of your sight for any period of time. This crab knows how to use a key.	Imagine this crab floating around in an aquarium half filled with water in little to no gravity. The water is floating all about and the crab is confused as can be.

Right after the tsunami, this plate was wet, but the sun is warming and drying the plate. Imagine looking at the plate and seeing the beads of water evaporate off it as it warms up. Feel the warm steam on your face as this happens.	The plate starts to get so <kanji>warm</kanji> that you could fry an <reading>on</reading>ion (<ja>おん</ja>) on it. Who doesn’t love fried onions?

The only creature powerful enough to withstand the force of these white water <kanji>spring</kanji>s is the mythical <reading>centaur</reading> (<ja>せん</ja>).
