You should play <reading>Nin</reading>tendo (<ja>にん</ja>). Nintendo really calms your nerves and makes being pregnant with some mutant baby not seem like that big of a deal anymore.	What game are you playing on the Nintendo? Maybe it’s a game where you kill alien invaders? That’s messed up.		5816	-	kanji Lesson_38
娠	Kanji	女, 辰	Woman, Landslide	radical, radical	Pregnant	Pregnant		<reading>しん</reading>				しん									A <radical>woman</radical> who has a <radical>landslide</radical> getting ready inside her is <kanji>pregnant</kanji>. And that baby is gonna come out like a landslide.	Picture an ultrasound of the pregnant woman, but instead of a little baby heartbeat, you hear a scary roaring sound. That's what being pregnant is like. Waiting for the landslide to come.	When you're <kanji>pregnant</kanji> the baby is constantly kicking you with their <reading>shin</reading>s (<ja>しん</ja>). Not their feet, their shins. And shins are really hard, let me tell you.	Imagine being pregnant and getting kicked by the shins of your baby all day, but especially all night. You're so tired. Please let this landslide come already.		5817	-	kanji Lesson_38

They do most of their own chores during the rest of the year, so winter is when you should ask them to do things for you.	To get the mole to <kanji>do</kanji> what you want, just give it a nice big hunk of <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>).	Moles will do anything for cheese, but honestly, wouldn't we all?		5818	-	kanji Lesson_38

"In this <kanji>edition</kanji> of ""The Dry Knife,"" there is a huge article written by Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) on how he kept his knives dry while campaigning."	The article on Genghis Khan was perhaps the best written article in the Dry Knife series to date. How did this magazine get such a big interview?		5819	-	kanji Lesson_38

To your mortal, human ears it sounds more like snow melting, birds chirping, and plants waking up.	Close your eyes and imagine all of the spring sounds that come down to you from heaven in the springtime. Mmm, you can almost smell the damp soil and rain.	In heaven, the ones that <kanji>play music</kanji> are the <reading>sou</reading>ls (<ja>そう</ja>) of the dead. They have a huge band up there, and even though it just seems like normal spring sounds to you, up there in heaven when the souls play music it's more like a huge, 100-part band!

Imagine the good qualities of this leader and how he inspired you to accompany him on this mission.	The leader you decided to <kanji>accompany</kanji> is none other than <reading>Han</reading> (<ja>はん</ja>) Solo. Who could be more inspiring? I’m surprised not more than half decided to accompany him. Han Solo is awesome.	Imagine yourself as you accompany Han Solo.

He needs more people to join his cause so he can get his horns removed. He’s embarrassed of them which is why he only travels at night, hence the lantern.	Imagine this shady leader approaching you in the night. The lantern light shines in your face. Would you join him?	The leader guy approaches you out of the darkness, his lantern held high. Oh no, not that guy. You've heard about his horn problem and you don't want to <kanji>join</kanji> him. You look around and spot a large <reading>hay</reading>stack (<ja>へい</ja>). You quickly jump into it and hide from him.	The last thing you wanted to do was join that guy so you hid in a haystack to avoid him.		5822	-	kanji Lesson_38

Right now it's standing up straight, but you want it to lean to one side instead. 	Why do you want this geoduck to lean? Try to come up with your own reason. And why don't you look up what a geoduck looks like one more time for good measure. You don't want to be able to get this image out of your head.	To get the geoduck to <kanji>lean</kanji> you put a piece of <reading>ca</reading>ke (<ja>けい</ja>) on one of its sides.	Watch as the geoduck slowly leans toward the cake, trying to get at it for a taste. But don't let it eat any! Keep putting the cake further and further away so the geoduck has to lean more.		5823	-	kanji Lesson_38

Look at this stamp. There's Columbus being hugged by a bunch of South American natives. Yikes, that's contrary to how things went, that's for sure.	Don't be the type of person who acts <kanji>contrary</kanji> to how they should and instead be like <reading>Kyaku</reading> (<ja>きゃく</ja>) the customer. They're always so nice and polite and they don't give diseases to entire populations of people.	Be contrary to the evildoers of the past and be like Kyaku instead.		5824	-	kanji Lesson_38
奥	Kanji	丶, 冂, 米, 大	Drop, Head, Rice, Big	radical, radical, radical, radical	Interior	Interior		おう	<reading>おく</reading>			おく	おう								If there’s a <radical>drop</radical> on your <radical>head</radical> and the <radical>rice</radical> is <radical>big</radical>, you know you’re in the <kanji>interior</kanji>. And by interior, I mean you’re actually inside someone. The rice is big because you’ve shrunk to a tiny size and are inside someone’s stomach. The drop on your head is actually digestive fluid.	Imagine being in the interior of someone’s tummy. See the big pieces of rice all around you as drops of stomach fluid continue to drop down on your head.	While you’re in the <kanji>interior</kanji> of this guy, you hear him break out in song. He starts singing “<reading>Ok</reading>lahoma” (<ja>おく</ja>) at the top of his lungs. The big pieces of rice slosh around as he sings and dances. “OOOOk-lahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain!”	If you’re unfamiliar with this Oklahoma song, check it out on YouTube. Imagine being in the interior of someone’s belly as you hear this song booming all around you.		5825	-	kanji Lesson_38

Tigers are smart hunters, so they need to consider all options and really think through a situation.	Look at this tiger as it approaches you. Think what things it has to consider. It has to consider how big of a threat you are and so on. You need to consider how you’re going to escape from this tiger.	It's <kanji>consider</kanji>ing you for so long that it takes out a <reading>ro</reading>be (<ja>りょ</ja>), a pipe, and an armchair and starts puffing away, staring intently at you. You didn't even know tigers could wear robes, but this one seems to use it to help itself think.	Consider this! Tigers look great in robes.		5826	-	kanji Lesson_38

When the heart is passed on to the next in line, it flies out of their body, and <kanji>suspend</kanji>s itself in the sky, for you to take.	You see the suspended heart in the distance, and make your way towards it.	You arrive at the <kanji>suspend</kanji>ed heart. There in front of it, protecting it, is <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>) the samurai. 	"""I've protected this suspended heart for you, for you are next in the lineage to receive it.""

You run in the direction of the cluster and one door stands out to you. You enter it.	Imagine seeing all these doors, this cluster of doors. You feel confused at which one to enter but finally pick one. Hear the door creak as you open it.	After you make it through the door, you come across another <kanji>cluster</kanji> of doors. Which one to choose? There's a loud thunderous sound coming from behind one and you decide to open it. Behind it, there's an entire <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) alley and people bowling, loudly!	Watch as clusters of pins fall when the bowling balls hit them. You back up and peek through one of the other doors in the cluster and it also houses a bowling alley. Huh.		5828	-	kanji Lesson_38

On the <kanji>handle</kanji>! Okay, so maybe it's not a handle and more of a railing, but for the sake of this kanji, picture a handle instead.	Imagine being on an escalator and wrapping your fingers around a small handle on your way up or down. It's still a bit precarious, truth be told.	"You put your hand on the <kanji>handle</kanji> and an old person leans in close to you and says, ""<reading><ja>暑か</ja></reading>?"" (<ja>あつか</ja>). He wants to know if the handle is ... hot?

The cat pirate was attacking you, so you took your fingers and pet his head and scratched his chin. Now he's calm and suppressed. He doesn't even remember why he was attacking you.	Imagine suppressing a cat pirate with your own fingers. His fur is so soft, but his nails are so sharp!	He forgot, but you know you had to <kanji>suppress</kanji> the cat pirate because he was trying to steal your egg <reading>yolk</reading> (<ja>よく</ja>). You were making breakfast on your ship and the cat pirate boarded you out of nowhere, and tried to take it by force.	Defend the yolk! Smell the smell of eggs in the air as you suppress the cat pirate. Maybe even share the yolk with him, once he's done trying to kill you for it.

Feel your fingers touching each and every shrimp, one by one, until they graze the one you select as the perfect shrimp. Slowly pull it out and lower it into your mouth. Munch munch... ahhh! The perfect shrimp.	You do this at every restaurant, party, and indoor sporting event and people start getting wise to your shrimp <kanji>select</kanji>ion methods. One day, as you attempt to select your shrimp, a sharp pain shoots through your finger. Ow! You pull your hand back to find... a <reading>tack</reading> (<ja>たく</ja>)!	Oh, woe is me!

Have you ever seen rice paddy flowers? They're beautiful. And if you can draw them you can capture that beauty and show it to everyone.	Imagine using your fingers to draw these rice paddy flowers. Don't worry about how well you can draw, this is so beautiful, anyone could capture it.	Even though you tried to <kanji>draw</kanji> the flowers as best you could, whenever someone looks at it they smell <reading>B.O.</reading> (<ja>びょう</ja>). Maybe it's because you were drawing for a really long time and kept sweating. Maybe it's because you are just a stinky person. But no one wants to look at your drawing for long because all they can smell is B.O.	To be fair, would you want to look at a drawing that makes you constantly smell stinky B.O.?

So in a way, it's just a <kanji>tray</kanji> for your weapon.	A big boat shaped like a plate is just a tray. You keep your weapons on it, nice and flat.	Unfortunately, this boat <kanji>tray</kanji> is so big and flat that it keeps reflecting the light into your eyes, so you have to put on a pair of big Ray-<reading>Ban</reading> (<ja>ばん</ja>) sunglasses.
