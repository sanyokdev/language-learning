## Reading Elements:
> ```html

>       <reading><jp>とけい</jp></reading>
>       <reading-audio>[sound:Vocab-とけい-Male.mp3]</reading>
>   </span>
> ```
## Reading Mnemonic:
> ```html
>The reading for this is pretty weird. <jp>計</jp> is all nice and normal, but <jp>時</jp> is <jp>と</jp> for some reason. It probably is coming from the vocab word <jp>時</jp> (<jp>とき</jp>), is my guess. But even if it is, it's shortened, making it a step more complicated. Maybe it's just better to imagine that your <vocabulary>watch</vocabulary> is a walky <reading>talky</reading> (<jp>とけい</jp>) and run with that?
