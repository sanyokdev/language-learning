He flies up instead so he doesn't have to think about falling.<br><br>

The wolverine hunts turkeys for a living, but on the weekends, he likes to play racquetball at the local gym. That’s why the turkey is getting hunted on a weekday.<br><br>

- Hint: You’ve probably seen those nature shows like on National Geographic. Think back to one of those shows where the hunter stalks its prey and leaps out in slow motion to do the murder.

15	式	Ritual,Ceremony,Equation	Ceremony,Construction	弋,工	"To <radical>construct</radical> a whole <radical>ceremony</radical>, you can’t just make it up on the spot. That is not a ceremony. A ceremony has a past. A ceremony is done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a <kanji>ritual</kanji> first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish ceremony.<br><br>

This kanji also means <kanji>equation</kanji> for some reason too. Just think of a ceremony that involves doing math and coming up with equations. How strange would that be? Pretend you're at this ceremony.<br><br>

- Hint: Ritual and Ceremony kind of mean the same things, sort of. Don't worry too much if you mix them up a little - both will help you to remember the other.

Think of the most ridiculous ceremony you can think of. Give it a shot – I’ll let you come up with the ridiculousness this time (it’s good practice). When you think of your mnemonic, make sure to imagine it with a Sheikh (an Arabic leader). Have the sheikh do something ridiculous to help you to think of this sheikh (<jp>しき</jp>) and then remember this on’yomi.<br><br>

""<reading>Ha</reading> (<jp>は</jp>)! Ha ha ha!"" you laugh up into the sky. The sun feels great on your face, making you feel lively! And that blue sky ain't too shabby either.<br><br>

- Hint: Say the ""ha ha ha"" part out loud while you imagine the weather clearing up. It'll help you to remember the reading of this kanji."

It doesn't do anything except for every day right at <kanji>noon</kanji>, when it tells you the time. ""Hey guyz, it's <kanji>noon</kanji>, mmk?""<br><br>

- Hint: Really try to imagine this giant shrimp on the sun as a normal thing that happens, without fail, every day. The shrimp also tells the time right at noon, every day (so important you stress remembering that it's noon, not some other time). Maybe you could have him sing a ""noon song"" in your imagination as well."	<jp>ちゅう</jp>	<reading><jp>ひる</jp></reading>	None	ひる	"At <kanji>noon</kanji>, the shrimp also puts on its high <reading>heel</reading>s (<jp>ひる</jp>) to get ready for the evening, where it wants to make sure it looks good for the other shrimp he/she meets later on.<br><br>

- Hint: Right after the shrimp's announcement, imagine it struggling to put on heels, while sitting on the sun. This shrimp is almost bigger than the sun, actually, so all its struggles with its heels are easy to see."
14	雰	Atmosphere	Rain,Part	雨,分	"<radical>Part</radical> <radical>rain</radical>, part other stuff. I imagine this is what people thought the <kanji>atmosphere</kanji> was made out of thousands of years ago.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine looking up into the sky, trying to figure out what the atmosphere up there is made out of. Your only lead: It's raining, a lot. So, the atmosphere must be partly made of rain, and it's just falling down."	<reading><jp>ふん</jp></reading>	None	None	ふん	"The reading for this kanji is actually the same as <jp>分</jp>s. One trick about complicated kanji is they often take the reading of one of the pieces that they're made from. In this case it's <jp>分</jp>, which is cool.<br><br>

- Hint: Also, studying the <kanji>atmosphere</kanji> is a ton of <reading>fun</reading> (<jp>ふん</jp>), if you're into that sort of thing."
33	諸	Various	Say,Someone	言,者	"They <radical>say</radical> <radical>someone</radical> with <kanji>various</kanji> talents is important.

- Hint: Steam comes out of the coral flowers because they hold a lot of water. They're flowers, but they're coral flowers, so they came from the ocean. Of course there's water in them, and if you boil that water steam will come out."	<reading><jp>じょう</jp></reading>	<jp>む</jp>	None	じょう	"As you watch the <kanji>steam</kanji> coming off the coral flowers, someone appears behind you. It is <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<jp>じょう</jp>), the big farmhand. ""Are you steaming coral?"" he asks. ""Smelled it a mile away. I love crunching me some coral.""<br><br>

- Hint: It's weird that Jourm is so sensitive to the smell of steaming coral. He's lived as a farmhand nowhere near the sea all his life... at least that's what he told you. And now he's in your house breathing in the steam really deeply with his nose practically in the pot."
33	肺	Lung	Moon,City	月,市	"There is a <radical>moon</radical> and a <radical>city</radical> inside your <kanji>lung</kanji>. Inside of your lung there is a city and above that city lies a moon. It’s a pretty sight, but also very strange. Moons and cities don’t usually reside inside lungs.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine having a moon and a city inside your lung. Feel their presence as you breathe in and breathe out. Also, <jp>月</jp> often refers to internal organs as well, so remember that when you see this kanji."	<reading><jp>はい</jp></reading>	None	None	はい	"Having a moon and city inside your <kanji>lung</kanji> inspires you to write a <reading>hai</reading>ku (<jp>はい</jp>).

And that if you didn't keep a good supply of thread inside, you'd run out.<br><br>

- Hint: Nostradamus says you should have a large supply of everything you use regularly. Thread, water, canned foods. You can't see the future, but he can, and if he's telling you to stock up on your inside supplies I think you should listen."
33	漠	Desert,Vague	Tsunami,Greenhouse	氵,莫	"A <radical>tsunami</radical> hits the <radical>greenhouse</radical>, destroying the last remaining plant life in the area. The tsunami recedes, and there is nothing but sand, and the lands become a <kanji>desert</kanji>.<br><br>

33	暮	Livelihood	Greenhouse,Sun	莫,日	"A <radical>greenhouse</radical> is already really good when it comes to a plant's livelihood. But add the <radical>sun</radical> into that equation and you have something really great for the plants. Their <kanji>livelihood</kanji> will be awesome, now!<br><br>

Cause only slimy people manipulate other people, so their fingers are slimy and sticky because they're covered in your syrup from mucking up your life.<br><br>

This also has another meaning: <kanji>chastity</kanji>. Just imagine if someone wanted you to keep your chastity and they called s.e.x. when someone ""puts their fingers in your syrup."" That would be pretty effective, right? Cause it's like, super gross.<br><br>

- Hint: ""Ah golly gee wiz, he sure got his fingers all up in my syrup again, dagnabbit.""

Being manipulative isn't cool. And your soul will suffer forever for it.<br><br>

Centaurs are taller than humans and roosters, so when they climb onto the roof with their horse legs they can see dawn starting before anyone else.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture that shadow on the roof, proclaiming it's a new day, but this time make sure you picture the outline of this centaur. He has a human top half and a horse bottom half. And he's yelling down at you, ""HEY THE SUN IS UP IT'S DAWN GET OUT OF BED!"""

The shrimp found no <kanji>reason</kanji> to translate yak because there are no yak in the sea and then the shrimp just started questioning everything in his life and fell apart.<br><br>

- Hint: The translation of the word yak was the reason this shrimp fell into despair and gave up the translation profession. Now everyone hates him. See this poor shrimp being harassed by others while they shout at him, “Yak! Yak! Yak!”"

This director has been going around kicking cameramen and punching actors and it’s really ruining his reputation. You need to domesticate him. The only way to do this is to shock him into submission.

The newspapers and fashion agencies couldn’t get enough of your sexy style.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine setting this sexy fashion trend on accident. Imagine what you were wearing when you got dressed in the dark. Probably a pretty strange, mismatched outfit."

- Hint: People who keep the cross in their hearts are supposed to be full of virtue, always doing the right thing, always helping others. But you aren't sure if you want to be virtuous, it's a lot of responsibility.

31	墓	Grave	Dirt,Greenhouse	土,莫	"There's a strange patch of <radical>dirt</radical> in this <radical>greenhouse</radical> that's actually a <kanji>grave</kanji>. Dig around a little and you'll find the marker buried in there. If you dig deeper you'll probably find less pleasant things.<br><br>

- Hint: I guess it makes sense to have a grave in a greenhouse.

This must be the grave of a great archer! But you probably shouldn't keep digging around in this grave looking for more stuff.<br><br>

If there's too much dirt outside the pool and not enough water inside, it's gonna look weird. We can't have that.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine seeing a pool that isn't equal. It's like a tiny kiddy pool with an inch of water. And it's surrounded by mounds of dirt. No no no, this won't do—add more water to make them equal."	<reading><jp>きん</jp></reading>	<jp>ひと</jp>	None	きん	"You spend a few hours making sure the water-to-dirt ratio is perfectly <kanji>equal</kanji>, not for yourself, but because the <reading>Kin</reading>g (<jp>きん</jp>) of England told you to. You may agree that equality is important, but it's the King's responsibility to keep things that way. Which is why he ordered you, small peon, to do the equalizing work for him.<br><br>

- Hint: Okay, so the existence of a king kind of makes things not, well, equal, for all people. But at least aesthetically everything will be!"
31	陸	Land	Building,Womb	阝,坴	"A <radical>building</radical> made from a <radical>womb</radical> must be placed upon the <kanji>land</kanji>.<br><br>

It only needs a little though, since its stomach is so thin, so you just make it hold the rest.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture your cyborg nibbling on the vegetables you cleat-kicked out of this tree. You give all of the things you don't like to your cyborg nowadays. Which is probably why there are so many weird things all over it..."
31	粉	Powder	Rice,Part	米,分	"If you grind <radical>rice</radical>, every <radical>part</radical> of it, eventually it will become a fine <kanji>powder</kanji>. You can then use this rice powder as a part to create some other dish. Some kind of cake, perhaps.<br><br>

A cucumber falls out of the note.<br><br>

- Hint: This cucumber is supposed to be cool and refreshing enough to rescue you from the heat. I guess it was too much to expect winter to come early just for you. At least cucumbers are yummy."

When people or animals you know pass away, you take their souls and store them in your dry warehouse for safekeeping. It's a public service, really.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine if you kept a bunch of souls in a warehouse. This way they can't haunt anyone. And they can't get lost out in the spirit world. The warehouse is best for them."

- Hint: Imagine trying to write a poem while riding a horse. It’d be really hard to do. I bet you’d be surprised if you managed to do it as well."	<reading><jp>きょう</jp></reading>	<jp>おどろ</jp>	None	きょう	"You might also be <kanji>surprised</kanji> to learn that you are to ride this horse all across <reading><jp>きょう</jp></reading>. That gives you a time limit. You have until you traverse <jp>きょうと</jp> to write this poem about winter.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine riding through <jp>きょうと</jp> on a horse. As if that wasn’t difficult enough for poem writing, now you have all the sights and sounds of <jp>きょうと</jp> to distract you as well."

- Hint: She has to count each grain out in order to divvy up the supply to last through the winter. Imagine yourself getting just a few grains today for food. It's not a good time for you guys :("	<reading><jp>すう</jp></reading>	<jp>かぞ, かず</jp>	None	すう	"Why are you so low on rice? It's because someone <reading>sue</reading>d your farm and took everything you owned. So, you had barely enough rice (or not enough).<br><br>

- Hint: You look at each cloud and each one is a different cool mom. They're each doing different cool mom things. You suddenly don't want to look at the clouds anymore."
8	買	Buy	Net,Shellfish	罒,貝	"There are some <radical>shellfish</radical> in a <radical>net</radical> that you can <kanji>buy</kanji>. You can't just buy loose shellfish. You can only buy the ones that are in the net, bagged up and ready for your money.<br><br>

This kanji also means <kanji>number in a series</kanji>, which is a lot like a turn. For example, you're number 3, so your turn will be number 3.<br><br>

- Hint: Go through in your mind the system your farm / village uses for deciding who has to sickle on any given day. It rotates, and it's a turn-based system. So, do you all stand in a line? Is there a calendar? Come up with something interesting, focusing on your turn in the process you come up with. <br><br>

- Hint:  It will be helpful to remember both the ""number in a series"" and ""turn"" meanings for the vocab coming up in the future."	<reading><jp>ばん</jp></reading>	None	None	ばん	"This <kanji>turn</kanji>-based rice sickle system is a contest as well!

- Hint: Keep repeating this pattern over and over, continually focusing in on how you need ""more"" trees to make this forest. For some reason the person working with you only goes up by one at a time, though, so you have to say it a lot (it'll help you to remember, anyways!)."
8	究	Research	Hole,Nine	穴,九	"You dig <radical>nine</radical> <radical>hole</radical>s for your <kanji>research</kanji>. You should always do research with nine variables so you can compare them and so there's an uneven number.<br><br>

It's a special mix of ketchup and catsup (yum!)<br><br>

- Hint: The cape covering the mouth represents how this bureau never talks about their secrets. The flag represents your country. Think about all the cool secret things the Bureau of Secret Things must have."	<reading><jp>きょく</jp></reading>	None	None	きょく	"The <kanji>bureau</kanji>'s best-kept secret is cloaking devices that <reading>cloak you</reading> (<jp>きょく</jp>) with the press of a button.<br><br>

- Hint: Now, this mnemonic isn’t perfectly close, but the goal is to get you close enough in your brain so that you can remember <jp>きょく</jp> later. If you can get to CLOAK YOU, then you can get to <jp>きょく</jp> much easier than just trying to get there from scratch. So imagine working in this bureau and getting to cloak yourself all the time."

Now it's going to be you <kanji>versus</kanji> the teacher on who determines how long this thing you're writing should be.<br><br>

- Hint: Okay. It's going to be you versus the teacher. Subject? Measuring physical length versus checking word count."	<reading><jp>たい</jp></reading>	None	None	たい	"You let your nerves get the better of you and right when it's about to be you <kanji>versus</kanji> your professor, you hand him a new <reading>tie</reading> (<jp>たい</jp>). Is this also the <kanji>opposite</kanji> of what you should be doing? Probably, since it's bribery. But no one can say no to a tie, right?<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine putting on your top hat and getting power from it. Then, you use that power to help someone.

- Hint: Note: Jo-Anne is the character we're using with <jp>じょ</jp> reading mnemonics. She is short compared to Jourm (<jp>じょう</jp>), the giant farmhand, which is how you'll differentiate the two similar readings."

You crawl around trying to find this tiny thing so that you can escape.<br><br>

- Hint: The walls are coming in closer, too. Make sure you feel a bit of peril as you look for this key. The walls have a slight opening at the bottom too, so if you don't find it before the wall goes over it, the key will be lost forever, and you'll be smushed!"

- Hint: The sick part of this is that those dollar <kanji>bills</kanji> were once this tree's friends.

The radical is technically <radical>blood</radical>, but you know that radical is just a drop (of blood) on a plate. So, you ask yourself... Is that really blood on the plate? Could it be? You decide to take a gamble and lick it off. When you taste it, it's definitely not blood. No, it's <reading>ketsup</reading> (<jp>けつ</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Feel the relief that you didn't just lick up someone's blood. Taste the ketsup taste, too. It's pretty good. Not quite ketchup, but not quite catsup. Yum!"

4	礼	Thanks	Spirit,Umbrella	ネ,乚	"Always remember to give <radical>umbrella</radical>s to the <radical>spirit</radical>s to show your <kanji>thanks</kanji>.

- Hint: Thanks for the new ray gun, spirit!"
5	皮	Skin	Slide,Branch	丿,支	"<radical>Slide</radical> down a <radical>branch</radical> and your <kanji>skin</kanji> will come off. Unlike what Tarzan will make you believe, you can't just slide around on branches, they're rough and painful and if you do it your skin will come sliding off and it will hurt.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine sliding down a slide made of a big, branch. The branch's bark digs into your skin and pulls it right off of your body."	<reading><jp>ひ</jp></reading>	<jp>かわ</jp>	None	ひ	"Without your <kanji>skin</kanji> to protect you, you feel the full <reading>he</reading>at (<jp>ひ</jp>) from the friction of your body going down the branch slide.<br><br>

4	打	Hit	Fingers,Street	扌,丁	"Take your <radical>fingers</radical> to the <radical>street</radical> to <kanji>hit</kanji> some people! Street fingers are for curling into a fist. And that street fist wants to do some hitting!<br><br>

If you've ever seen Lost, this will sound familiar... on the hatch, there's actually a series of <kanji>number</kanji>s that you don't understand.<br><br>

- Hint: What are these numbers? What do they mean? Think over it for a while, get frustrated, and try to figure it out.

You say ""yes,"" and the voice gives you the numbers and you're in! You go down into the prison, where there is one prisoner: Grandpa Koichi (<reading><jp>ごう</jp></reading>).<br><br>

Note: For <jp>ごう</jp> reading mnemonics, we use <jp>ごういち</jp> (grandpa Koichi) because <jp>こういち</jp> is used for the <jp>こう</jp> reading. <jp>こう</jp> becomes <jp>ごう</jp> becomes ""grandpa <jp>ごういち</jp>.""<br><br>

- Hint: <jp>ごういち</jp> keeps saying numbers as you free him from the prison. Just one after another. Numbers numbers numbers. Hopefully old man <jp>ごういち</jp> isn't crazy."
4	主	Master,Main	Master	主	"The radical <radical>master</radical> and the kanji <kanji>master</kanji> have the same meanings!<br><br>

- Hint: Picture this master of water controlling the droplet as it flies around inside these chutes, like he's solving a difficult puzzle with it. Astounding!"
3	矢	Arrow	Arrow	矢	"The <radical>arrow</radical> radical and the <kanji>arrow</kanji> kanji are the same. Sort of a ""straight"" shot to memorizing this kanji, you know?<br><br>

What is this arrow doing? It’s following around all the <reading>Ya</reading>nkee (<jp>や</jp>) baseball players, stalking them, waiting to make its move (I’ll let you decide what its “move” is).<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the arrow as a human-sized living thing with legs, arms, and clothes, though. Strangely, it’s able to walk around even though it's an arrow. It has some kind of agenda. Make it a bit evil, if you can. What a strange thing…"
3	用	Task,Use	Task	用	"The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>task</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>task</kanji> as well.<br><br>

3	台	Machine	Private,Mouth	ム,口	"You have a <radical>private</radical> <radical>mouth</radical> that's a <kanji>machine</kanji>. But you have to keep your machine mouth private because it would scare all the non-machine people around you.<br><br>

You find dye the same shade as your normal mouth and just slap it on there.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine being so afraid that people will find out about your machine mouth that you have to dye it to match a normal human mouth. Oh, when will this discrimination against machine-kind end?!"
3	古	Old	Old	古	"The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>old</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>old</kanji> as well.<br><br>

Note: This ""old"" does not refer to people. Think of it as ""old things"" instead.<br><br>

*Note:* Come up with a <jp>子</jp> character you can use for all the <jp>こ</jp> reading mnemonics going forward. This child will show up many times throughout your mnemonic journey, and it will help if you imagine the same character the whole time.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine a <jp>子</jp> looking at old things. A record player. A gameboy. A cassette player. Kids just don't get old things.<br><br>

- Hint: Note: When you see the (<jp>古</jp>) radical in a kanji, there's a good chance it will use the reading <jp>こ</jp>."
3	冬	Winter	Winter,Two	夂,二	"We have the <radical>winter</radical> radical and the <radical>two</radical> radical (though it's sort of slanted). What's two times the winter radical, if radicals are just a part of a kanji? Two times would be enough to create the entire kanji, which is also <kanji>winter</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: You could also think, ""Winter too"" instead of ""two."" Because, this kanji is in fact ""<kanji>winter</kanji> too."""	<jp>とう</jp>	<reading><jp>ふゆ</jp></reading>	None	ふゆ	"<kanji>Winter</kanji> is the time of year you give out presents: ""one fo' you, one fo'you.

- Hint: Feel the pain of your toe going away. Think about the other side of the <kanji>door</kanji>, where your <reading>toe</reading> is probably rolling around after it blasted off your foot."
3	引	Pull	Bow,Stick	"弓,<i class=""radical-stick""></i>"	"If you have a <radical>bow</radical> and a <radical>stick</radical> you need to <kanji>pull</kanji> the two back together to shoot it. If you can't pull it, you won't be shooting anything.<br><br>

2	本	Book,Origin,Real,Main	Book	本	"The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>book</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>book</kanji> as well.<br><br>

Take note that the second, third, and fourth meanings of this kanji are <kanji>origin</kanji>, <kanji>real</kanji>, and <kanji>main</kanji>. You can figure this out by thinking about how books mainly have their origins in real life.<br><br>

- Hint: Make sure you know those radicals, yo! And good luck with all the meanings (sorry sorry sorry)."	<reading><jp>ほん</jp></reading>	<jp>もと</jp>	None	ほん	"<kanji>Book</kanji>s are one of the best ways to <reading>hone</reading> (<jp>ほん</jp>) your intellect, you know?<br><br>

2	四	Four	Mouth,Legs	口,儿	"Imagine contorting yourself in such a way that your <radical>legs</radical> end up inside your <radical>mouth</radical>. You have bent your body in all the wrong ways in order to achieve this. In fact, if you look at yourself, you look like a square now... You're just a person with <kanji>four</kanji> sides.<br><br>

- Hint: If you can get to square, you should be able to get to four as well, since squares always have four sides."	<reading><jp>し</jp></reading>	<jp>よん, よ</jp>	None	し	"This amazing feat, which turned you into a <kanji>four</kanji> sided square, has you looking like a four sided animal: the <reading>shee</reading>p (<jp>し</jp>). Look at yourself in the mirror and see an adorable four-sided sheep looking back at you. (You can't see the other sides because mirrors aren't 3D and whatnot. So you're a bit cartoonish.)<br><br>

- Hint: What's better than one four sided sheep?"
2	円	Yen,Round,Circle	Head,Lid	冂,亠	"The combination of radicals for this kanji may not be obvious at first, but if you look carefully you'll see it. The <radical>lid</radical> is inside the <radical>head</radical> for this kanji because it's holding something in. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of <kanji>yen</kanji> coins, the currency of Japan!<br><br>

- Hint: Another thing that will help is to associate the word <kanji>round</kanji> to this kanji, because it has both of these meanings. Both are right, and if you learn one that's better than not learning either, but maybe if you think about how round the coins themselves are inside this person's head, you'll remember this one too."	<reading><jp>えん</jp></reading>	<jp>まる</jp>	None	えん	"What does the word <kanji>yen</kanji> sound like? It sounds like <jp>えん</jp>. Why? because back in the day, Japanese used to have a ""ye"" sound, but now it doesn't. Instead, it's an ""e"" sound, which is why yen = <reading><jp>えん</jp></reading>!<br><br>

- Hint: Picture these <kanji>round</kanji> <jp>えん</jp> in your mind. Maybe look some up online too, just to be safe."
2	六	Six	Lid,Fins	亠,ハ	"Just imagine a beast with a <radical>lid</radical> for a head and <radical>fins</radical> for feet, running around looking as insane as possible (really imagine it!). When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number <kanji>six</kanji> is the devil's number.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine this beast doing various crazy things, the crazier the better (to help you remember). Make sure all these things are associated with the devil and the devil's number (<kanji>six</kanji>), so you can remember the meaning of this kanji."	<reading><jp>ろく</jp></reading>	<jp>む</jp>	None	ろく	"Whenever we need to remember the reading <jp>ろく</jp> we just use the word <reading>rock</reading>. <br><br>

So, think about the devil and the devil's number. What is often associated with those things? Why, <reading>rock</reading> (<jp>ろく</jp>) and roll is. Imagine the lid-head fin-legged beast suddenly blasting out rock music in the middle of his destructive mayhem.<br><br>

- Hint: Sing along with the monster, if it helps you to remember the reading of this kanji."

You know it's a genius because they're actually a <reading>cy</reading>borg (<jp>さい</jp>).<br><br>

2	丸	Circle,Circular,Round	Nine,Drop	九,丶	"What's something with <radical>nine</radical> sides? Just add a <radical>drop</radical> and you'll have something that's almost a <kanji>circle</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: It's not quite a <kanji>circle</kanji> though. You just need to add a <radical>drop</radical> of liquid to the edges to smooth it out to become a full circle."	<jp>がん</jp>	<reading><jp>まる</jp></reading>	None	まる	"Do you know about the adorable cat Maru? If not, you should check it out. May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worth while.<br><br>

When you think about a circle, think about <reading>Maru</reading> all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.<br><br>

Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to ""Maru.""<br><br>

- Hint: Obviously if you ""don't know this reading"" well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos. I'll understand... just make sure you come back someday, okay?"
2	了	Finish,Complete,End	Barb	亅	"Think about it this way. There is a famous fishing lure inventor, working on his best work ever. He’s old, and he’s been trying to make the best fishing lure for the last 50 years, and knows this will be his last invention. Then he figures it out. He takes one <radical>barb</radical>, and connects the end of it to the top of another <radical>barb</radical>. When he does this, he knows his work is finally <kanji>finish</kanji>ed.<br><br>

- Hint: Make sure you look at this amazing fishing lure too - hold it in your hand, see the two barbs fused together. Think about how strange this lure is. Is this really the best in the world? Will this really finish all other fishing lures?"	<reading><jp>りょう</jp></reading>	None	None	りょう	"How does the fish lure maker test his newly <kanji>finish</kanji>ed lure out? The one he just finished? He gets in a <reading>row</reading> (<jp>りょう</jp>) boat and rows out into the sea.<br><br>

- Hint: Make him think that he can’t just use his new lure on the side of the lake / ocean / whatever. He has to get out there, but unfortunately all he has is a crappy row boat. Imagine the row boat being terrible, leaky, and dangerous, which is why you’re surprised when he goes for it. That’s a terrible row boat to use! If you do this, you'll focus your mind on the rowboat part of things, which will help you to remember the reading of this kanji."
2	丁	Street	Street	丁	"The kanji and the radical that look like this are exactly the same. They are both <kanji>street</kanji>.<br><br>

A lady. Big, black curly hair and red eyes. It is the <kanji>street</kanji>-woman, Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<jp>ちょう</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> is a character you'll see a lot throughout WaniKani, anytime the reading is <jp>ちょう</jp> like this one. A lore will develop around her, so the more vividly you can imagine your Mrs. Chou right now, the easier things will get later. In general, she's a mean, evil woman, so as long as you imagine her within those parameters, you're good. And, when I say she is a ""street-woman"" in the mnemonic, I don't mean she is homeless. She has a nice, middle-class home that's not outside of her financial means. What I'm saying is she wanders the streets looking for evil things to do. These are HER streets. So whenever you see the street radical, know that Mrs. Chou is probably going to show up!"
2	夕	Evening	Evening	夕	"The <radical>evening</radical> radical and the <kanji>evening</kanji> kanji are the same. If you know the radical you know the meaning of the kanji.<br><br>

- Hint: Note: All the <jp>ゆう</jp> readings will use the word ""youths"" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these ""youths"" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world, just like how people treat millennials nowadays."
1	二	Two	Two	二	"The kanji <kanji>two</kanji> and the radical <radical>two</radical> are the exact same things. Therefore, you know the kanji for two already!<br><br>

It's two lines, that's not all that hard to remember!"	<reading><jp>に</jp></reading>	<jp>ふた</jp>	None	に	"Think of all the things you have <kanji>Two</kanji> of. What is the most important? Some would say eyes, some would say ears. I would say the <reading>knee</reading> (<jp>に</jp>) because if you didn't have them, it'd be really hard to go up stairs.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine yourself without two knees, and see what it would be like. What would give you trouble? What couldn't you do? Just imagining this for a minute or two will help you to remember the reading of this kanji more effectively."

- Hint: The leader of the yakuza is just showing you an example of a knife. Maybe to scare you? Why would an example of what a knife is scare you, though? Coming from the leader of the yakuza, this is a weird tactic."	<reading><jp>れい</jp></reading>	<jp>たと</jp>	None	れい	"""This is an <kanji>example</kanji>,"" the leader of the yakuza tells you. Next time, I'll show you an example of a <reading>ray</reading> (<jp>れい</jp>) gun.<br><br>

That doesn't sound like something your mama would say, and you begin to <kanji>doubt</kanji> that she's your mama at all! She usually takes them and washes them in the sink. You doubt you could hang them on the coat rack even if you tried.<br><br>

- Hint: Your mama is acting weird. You doubt she's really your mama. What are you going to do?"	<reading><jp>ぎ</jp></reading>	<jp>うたが</jp>	None	ぎ	"Your <kanji>doubt</kanji> is growing really strong, so you decide to test your mama by putting her head in a <reading>gui</reading>llotine (<jp>ぎ</jp>)! Oh come on, don't feel bad, you're preeettty sure this isn't your real mama.<br><br>

- Hint: Watch the doubt wash over her face as she looks up at you from her position in the guillotine. Finally she mutters, ""Well, this is disappointing, and I doubt you hung up your spoons and arrows on the coat rack before trying to murder your ol' mum."""

""Perhaps <reading>a key</reading> (<jp>えき</jp>) would help?"" asks the station master, as he goes over to open the door to the train.<br><br>

- Hint: Instead of saying ""a key"" he says ""eh key."" How strange. Imagine the station master saying it like this with his weird accent. You ask him if he has ""a key"" and he replies with, ""What is a key?"" Then you say ""eh key."" He totally understands you now."

What is Han doing here, so hidden away? He's obviously hiding from Jabba because he doesn't want to get frozen in carbonite again.<br><br>

- Hint: Make sure you get to the point where you pull this anti-social guy's beard off, to reveal Han Solo beneath. Be surprised... not just because he's Han Solo, but because he's real, too! Maybe you can yell out ""Han! Your people need you!"""

- Hint: Picture an insect, on its back, being blown around under a table. Feel the wind pushing you as you try to save the poor thing.<br><br>

These are Japan's <kanji>states</kanji> or <kanji>province</kanji>s.<br><br>

- Hint: Also, another way to think of this is that the river radical is actually just three rivers, separating drops, which are capitals of various states. Rivers are usually great ways to divide up a country, and states are one way to do it!"	<reading><jp>しゅう</jp></reading>	None	None	しゅう	"Each <kanji>state</kanji> has its own <reading>shoe</reading> (<jp>しゅう</jp>) to represent it.

The last one you come to does not have a hat. He is the king of <reading>Zen</reading> (<jp>ぜん</jp>) Buddhism. He has simple clothes and a shaved head, unlike all the other fancy kings standing around nearby.<br><br>

- Hint: To add to this story and make it more memorable, you can imagine the other kings getting upset, saying things like ""<kanji>All</kanji> kings must wear hats! You are no king!"" The king of <reading>Zen</reading> Buddhism just ignores them and begins to meditate."
6	両	Both	Ground,Head,Mountain	一,冂,山	"Under the <radical>ground</radical>, which you dug into, you found two great finds. You found <kanji>both</kanji> a <radical>mountain</radical> and a <radical>head</radical>, two strange things to find underground.<br><br>

- Hint: You'll want to focus on the part where you find <kanji>both</kanji>, not so much the things themselves. Think about how you can't believe you did so well finding both things at once.

6	化	Change	Leader,Spoon	ｲ,匕	"A <radical>leader</radical> with a <radical>spoon</radical> is a powerful thing. Even something like a spoon when given to the right man or woman can make great <kanji>change</kanji> in the world.<br><br>

- Hint: Of course, doing something like this is utterly amazing. Feel amazed in your imagination, because if you don't, then it'll be hard to remember the reading for this kanji. If you are amazed, you'll know that spoons going to cars = the reading is <jp>か</jp>, so make sure you take the time to be amazed."
5	音	Sound	Stand,Sun	立,日	"For some reason, you are <radical>stand</radical>ing on the <radical>sun</radical>. It's obviously very hot, but the thing you notice most is the <kanji>sound</kanji> of you burning up.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine a super loud sizzling sound, drowning everything else out. It's ridiculously loud, and hurts your ears more than the sun's heat hurts your skin."	<reading><jp>おん</jp></reading>	<jp>おと, ね</jp>	None	おん	"This <kanji>sound</kanji> isn't just loud, it's familiar. Finally you place it: <reading>on</reading>ions (<jp>おん</jp>)!<br><br>

5	草	Grass,Weed	Flowers,Sun,Cross	艹,日,十	"You plant your <radical>flowers</radical> in the light of the <radical>sun</radical> in the shape of a <radical>cross</radical>, but it's too hot—the sun is too strong—and you end up with <kanji>grass</kanji>. Flowers can't grow in these conditions.<br><br>

- Hint: Think of how disappointed you are. You wanted a beautiful cross of flowers, and now you just have a big overgrown patch of thick grass. It isn't even pretty green grass, it's a little brown and damaged from the sun."	<jp>そう</jp>	<reading><jp>くさ</jp></reading>	None	くさ	"The <kanji>grass</kanji> on top is brown and burned from the sun, so you need to take a <reading>cool saw</reading> (<jp>くさ</jp>) and hack the tops off. The saw is actually physically cool to the touch, to help heal the grass' sunburned bits. It just happens to look cool too.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine using your cool saw to saw off the heads of all of this grass. You made the cross pretty big, so there is a ton of grass to get through. The sun is beating down on you and the grass too, which isn't making it any easier."
5	雨	Rain	Rain	雨	"The radical for <radical>rain</radical> and the kanji for <kanji>rain</kanji> are the same thing.<br><br>

As in, drops would move out of their normal flight path just to hit you on your head? You'd be a lot wetter, that's for sure.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine a world where each rain drop had to choose a target to aim for. How strange would rainfall be? Also, <jp>あめ</jp> and ""aim"" don't really sound too much alike, but the goal is to use ""aim"" to get to <jp>あめ</jp>, so make sure to take note of that in your mind as you learn the reading."
5	金	Gold	Gold	金	"The <radical>gold</radical> radical and the <kanji>gold</kanji> kanji are the same!<br><br>

- Hint: Just know your radicals and you'll be golden, so to speak."	<reading><jp>きん</jp></reading>	<jp>かね</jp>	None	きん	"The most <kanji>gold</kanji> in the land belongs to the <reading>Kin</reading>g (<jp>きん</jp>) of England.

- Hint: Picture the King on a huge pile of gold. Gold coins, gold candelabras, gold ponies. He's laughing and pointing at all of it while making very strong eye contact with you."
5	林	Forest,Grove	Tree	木	"You have a <radical>tree</radical> and another <radical>tree</radical>. You basically have yourself a <kanji>forest</kanji>!<br><br>

- Hint: Follow the logic of this one and you should be okay."	<jp>りん</jp>	<reading><jp>はやし</jp></reading>	None	はやし	"So, now you have this <kanji>forest</kanji> and you want to cut it down (so much money!). But, you don't have any tools, only your hands. You think... I've done karate for a while, so I can probably chop it down that way. You get in a chopping stance, then do your battle cry and hit: ""<reading>HAYA ... .SHI******</reading>!""<br><br>

- Hint: Obviously that didn't work well - you'll want to focus on your battle cry plus indecent swearing right afterwards to remember this reading."
5	学	Study,Learn,Learning	Viking,Child	"<i class=""radical-viking""></i>,子"	"You have a wild <radical>viking</radical> <radical>child</radical> you have to take care of. He won't do anything but <kanji>study</kanji>, surprisingly. You can't get him to eat, use the bathroom, or anything else. He just wants to study.<br><br>

- Hint: Of course, this isn't what you'd expect of a little viking child. It's the opposite. That's why it's so surprising! He loves to study!"	<reading><jp>がく</jp></reading>	<jp>まな</jp>	None	がく	"This crazy viking child who prefers <kanji>study</kanji> over pillaging (and other viking activities)... the other vikings just stop and <reading>gawk</reading> (<jp>がく</jp>) at him when they walk by.<br><br>

- Hint: You should tell the other vikings to stop gawking at this child. Just because he likes to study doesn't mean he's a bad viking..."

Behind him, a bunch of his guards also on scooters and wielding axes appear and move <kanji>close</kanji> to you. <br><br>

- Hint: The King is now so near to you his nose and mustache are tickling your face. He's holding the axe high above his head and saying, ""I can get as close to you as I want and you can't stop me because I'm the King. I can get sooooo close. Look, I'm not touching you though!"""

Still running, you turn around and see your soul running a few steps behind you.<br><br>

- Hint: Running really takes it out of you. In this case, it takes your soul out of you. Don't worry, when you stop your soul will collide with you again and everything will be okay. (Probably.)"
5	言	Say	Say	言	"The <radical>say</radical> radical and the <kanji>say</kanji> kanji are the same!<br><br>

- Hint: Know your radicals, yo!"	<reading><jp>げん, ごん</jp></reading>	<jp>い, こと</jp>	None	げん, ごん	"If you aren't sure what to <kanji>say</kanji>, just think about <reading>Gen</reading>ji (<jp>げん</jp>) and ask yourself, ""What would Genji say?""<br><br>

- Hint: Genji is a real smooth talker. In fact, he can talk his way out of anything. If you can just stay calm and think ""What would Genji say?"" before saying anything, you'll probably end up saying something cool instead of something lame."
5	形	Shape,Form,Appearance	Lantern,Hair	开,彡	"You're walking at night when you discover a <radical>lantern</radical> covered entirely in <radical>hair</radical>, making it a very strange <kanji>shape</kanji>. In fact, this is a <kanji>form</kanji> you'd never expect a lantern to take.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture all the different shapes this hairy lantern could take in your mind."	<reading><jp>けい, ぎょう</jp></reading>	<jp>かた, かたち</jp>	None	けい, ぎょう	"You stare at the <kanji>shape</kanji> until you finally recognize it: <reading>ca</reading>ke (<jp>けい</jp>)! Well, it's hairy, glowing cake, but it's still shaped like a big slice of cake.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture the shape of this hairy, glowing cake."
9	売	Sell	Samurai,Forehead,Legs	士,冖,儿	"There’s a <radical>samurai</radical> with (just) his <radical>forehead</radical> and <radical>legs</radical>. Everything in between is missing. What happened to everything in between? He was low on money, so he had to <kanji>sell</kanji> it all, leaving him with only the top and the bottom.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine this terrifying samurai. You have legs… okay, that’s normal. But, then you have just a giant forehead on the top of everything else, walking around. It's pretty scary that someone would sell such important parts of their body."	<reading><jp>ばい</jp></reading>	<jp>う</jp>	None	ばい	"If you see a samurai trying to <kanji>sell</kanji> all their body parts here's what you should say, ""<reading>Bye</reading> (<jp>ばい</jp>)!"" and just get the heck out of there. Actually, if anyone tries to sell you a body part you should probably say bye over and over until you can get away from them.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine saying, ""Bye,"" loudly into the forehead of a samurai trying to sell you the rest of their face. If you say it loud enough it will distract them while you run away."
5	声	Voice	Samurai,Flag,Stick	"士,尸,<i class=""radical-stick""></i>"	"You have a <radical>samurai</radical> with a <radical>flag</radical> on a <radical>stick</radical>. On his flag is this symbol, the kanji for <kanji>voice</kanji>. Why does he have that there? He feels like his Shogun isn't giving him and his fellow Samurai a voice, so he's brought a flag with the word ""voice"" written on it to protest.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine him and other samurai with their flags on sticks waving them around shouting things like ""we want a voice in politics!"" etc., etc."	<jp>せい</jp>	<reading><jp>こえ</jp></reading>	None	こえ	"Once you start asking the samurai more specific questions about how he wants more <kanji>voice</kanji> he starts playing <reading>coy</reading> (<jp>こえ</jp>) with you. He doesn't really know what he wants, he's just here for the sake of protesting.<br><br>

- Hint: Then you ask him out on a date. He still plays coy with you... one of those samurai, I guess."
5	作	Make	Leader,Key	ｲ,乍	"The <radical>leader</radical>'s <radical>key</radical> is the key that <kanji>make</kanji>s all the other keys. It's sort of like the one ring to rule them all, the one ring to bind them... except with keys.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the leader taking his key to open up a safe that has a button to make other keys for the underlings. No key is as great as this key, though."	<reading><jp>さく, さ</jp></reading>	<jp>つく</jp>	None	さく, さ	"You <kanji>make</kanji> a key for an underling, and he looks at it disapprovingly (even though you're their leader!). He simply says, ""this key <reading>sucks</reading>"" (<jp>さく</jp>) and then walks off. How could this be?<br><br>

- Hint: Feel angry about this. Maybe you should kick your foot in his mouth and make him <reading>suck</reading> on that.<br><br>

- Hint: Also keep in mind that there's another reading that pops up too that's <reading><jp>さ</jp></reading>. It's similar to <jp>さく</jp>, though, and I think you'll be able to learn both the readings via the vocabulary."
5	行	Go	Go	行	"The <radical>go</radical> radical and the <kanji>go</kanji> kanji are exactly the same!<br><br>

- Hint: If you know your radicals well enough (and you do), you'll know this kanji."	<reading><jp>こう, ぎょう</jp></reading>	<jp>い, おこな, ゆ</jp>	None	こう, ぎょう	"""<kanji>Go</kanji>!"" someone is telling you. ""Go! Go! Go!"" That person is <reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>. He is holding his finger out, and pointing at your WaniKani reviews. ""Go! Go!"" Then, he over-enunciates the word ""go"" by saying ""<reading>GYOU!</reading>!"" (<jp>ぎょう</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: You try to go another direction, and he just yells and points louder: ""GO!"""
5	考	Think,Consider	Coffin,Beggar	"耂,<i class=""radical-beggar""></i>"	"In a <radical>coffin</radical> is someone <radical>begging</radical>. But, it won't work. You won't listen. So, the man in the coffin just begins to <kanji>think</kanji>: What could I have done better in my life? Why am I in this situation? How will I get out? Think, damnit, think!!<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine him changing from a begging position to a stereotypical ""thinking"" position, hand on chin, eyebrows furrowed. Focus on the beggar's thinking. This is a pretty abstract idea to imagine, so it will be important to create a very vivid picture in your mind's eye."	<reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>	<jp>かんが</jp>	None	こう	"What is the beggar <kanji>think</kanji>ing of? A thought bubble pops up into existence near his head. In it is a picture of <reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>! He's thinking that if <jp>こういち</jp> was here, he'd save him. Oh, if only <jp>こういち</jp> could save us all!<br><br>

- Hint: Then, the beggar realizes that he is <jp>こういち</jp>. You're burying <jp>こういち</jp> in a coffin alive and all he can think of is himself."
8	池	Pond	Alligator,Tsunami	也,氵	"The poor <radical>alligator</radical> was taken far inland by a <radical>tsunami</radical>. Now his only source of water is a tiny <kanji>pond</kanji> that barely fits his body, and doesn't even provide much food.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the alligator riding the tsunami in. When he hits the ground, and the water recedes, he's all alone in a pond, but it doesn't provide much for him. Imagine him looking for food in the little, shallow pond. Imagine him trying to stay wet... it's just not a great situation to be in, unfortunately."	<reading><jp>ち</jp></reading>	<jp>いけ</jp>	None	ち	"The worst part about this <kanji>pond</kanji> is that the only thing for the alligator to eat is <reading>chee</reading>se (<jp>ち</jp>). Cheese may be yummy for humans, but alligators hate it. They'd rather eat the cow the cheese came from. Sadly, this pond is full of cheese.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture an alligator crying in a pond full of cheese. It's eating a piece really slowly and weeping."
5	多	Many,Much,Lots Of	Evening	夕	"How many <radical>evenings</radical> are there? There are <kanji>many</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: If you accidentally think ""a lot"" or something similar, that's okay too. It's the basic meaning that counts, and all these things are pretty close, though eventually you want to get to the point where you know that this kanji does in fact mean <kanji>many</kanji>."	<reading><jp>た</jp></reading>	<jp>おお</jp>	None	た	"To remember the reading <jp>た</jp> we use the word ""Taco""<br><br>

Let's start with the kanji meaning: <kanji>many</kanji>. You go outside in the evening (because that's what this kanji is made up of) and are surprised when you're hit by <kanji>many</kanji> <reading>ta</reading>cos flying from the sky. For some reason it's raining tacos, and of course you have no idea why.<br><br>

- Hint: The tacos pelt you and knock you off your feet. Hard shell, soft shell, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese... it's terrible. And there are so many of them, flying from the sky to drown you in tacos. This is absolutely absurd (and you should think that too, so you remember the reading)."
5	光	Sunlight,Light	Triceratops,Pi	"<i class=""radical-triceratops""></i>,兀"	"You see a <radical>triceratops</radical> in the distance. But, it's odd. It's perfectly <radical>pi</radical> shaped (that is, circular). Some kind of piceratops, if you will. The reason they are this shape is because they want to absorb as much <kanji>sunlight</kanji> (or just <kanji>light</kanji> is fine, too) as possible. They evolved to be round so they don't have any corners casting a shadow.<br><br>

- Hint: Absorbing sunlight is natural for reptiles, after all. And a round one can absorb even more light. Imagine it sitting in a round spot of sun, enjoying the warmth. What a rare sight you've come across!"	<reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>	<jp>ひかり, ひか</jp>	None	こう	"As you watch this majestic beast absorbing <kanji>sunlight</kanji>, suddenly several dozen feral (<reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>)s burst from various hiding spots, spears in hand. Oh no! Those <jp>こういち</jp>s are hunting this rare piceratops!<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine many different (but also kind of the same) <jp>こういち</jp>s attacking and throwing spears at the piceratops. But, because it was able to charge up in the sunlight, it uses its powers to shoot light in all directions, rendering all the <jp>こういち</jp>s momentarily blind, allowing it to escape."
4	赤	Red	Red	赤	"The radical for <radical>red</radical> and the kanji for <kanji>red</kanji> are the same thing!<br><br>

- Hint: What a lucky ducky - as long as you know your radicals, you'll know this kanji's meaning as well!"	<jp>せき</jp>	<reading><jp>あか</jp></reading>	None	あか	"Think of Fozzie Bear. He says ""Wakka wakka wakka"" a lot. Now, think of an evil, <kanji>red</kanji> (and I mean totally red) Fozzie Bear. He drops the ""w"" and just says ""<reading>Aka</reading> Aka Aka,"" because he's totally evil.<br><br>

- Hint: You'll have to think of him as really, really red, though. Like, a glowing, searing kind of red. Red enough for you to associate red with this evil Fozzie Bear. If you do, then you'll be good to go (as long as you know his catch phrase as well)."
4	見	See	See	見	"The radical <radical>see</radical> and the kanji <kanji>see</kanji> are exactly the same!<br><br>

- Hint: Make sure you're studying your radicals. If you do, you'll know a lot of kanji as well, almost magically!"	<jp>けん</jp>	<reading><jp>み</jp></reading>	None	み	"You see something. It's walking towards you, but you need to see better. When the person comes close, you realize ""That person is <reading>me</reading> (<jp>み</jp>)!""<br><br>

- Hint: The struggling to see bit is pretty important - make sure that you slowly see a little better and better as the person comes closer, but it's difficult the whole time (struggles are good for memory). Then, it starts to become more and more clear, and you start saying ""that can't be <reading>me</reading>. No way it's me..."" When the person comes up to you (the person, being you) you learn about parallel universes and other fabulous things. Still, the whole time you can't stop thinking about how ""this person looks just like me... no, this person is me!"""
4	村	Village	Tree,Measurement	木,寸	"Someone’s taking <radical>measurements</radical> of the <radical>trees</radical>… Why is someone taking measurements of trees? These people are planning to take the trees and cut them down to make their <kanji>village</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: There is a whole group of people out there who are measuring these trees. Imagine them asking each other “do you think this will be a good tree for our village center?” and other people nodding in agreement or disagreement as they measure."	<jp>そん</jp>	<reading><jp>むら</jp></reading>	None	むら	"They take all the wood back to where they're building their <kanji>village</kanji> and once they construct the village center they paint a <reading>mura</reading>l (<jp>むら</jp>) on the side of it. The mural is of the forest where they got the tree from so they remember the building's origins.<br><br>

- Hint: Look at the mural on the side of this newly constructed village center. So many trees! Visualize the whole process as the tree becomes a building as you gaze and reflect on the message of the mural."
4	糸	Thread	Thread	糸	"The <radical>thread</radical> radical and <kanji>thread</kanji> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.<br><br>

- Hint: This is why it's good to make sure you know your radicals."	<jp>し</jp>	<reading><jp>いと</jp></reading>	None	いと	"You have some <kanji>thread</kanji>... what's the first thing you do with it? You take it and put it in your mouth, and start sucking it down like spaghetti. You have decided to <reading>eat</reading> (<jp>いと</jp>) the thread.<br><br>

- Hint: Think about how it tastes. Think about how it feels in your throat. Let it get caught on your teeth and around your tongue. It's a weird feeling having thread in your mouth, and you want to use that weird feeling to remember you're going to <reading>eat</reading> it."
4	竹	Bamboo	Bamboo	竹	"The <radical>bamboo</radical> radical and the <kanji>bamboo</kanji> kanji are exactly the same!<br><br>

- Hint: Just make sure you know your radicals!"	None	<reading><jp>たけ</jp></reading>	None	たけ	"There's a little <kanji>bamboo</kanji> shrub sitting there, holding onto a lollipop. Because you're bigger than the bamboo shrub, you just <reading>take</reading> (<jp>たけ</jp>) it from the bamboo, causing it to cry.<br><br>

- Hint: Of course, focus on the absurdity of a bamboo shrub that can cry and eat a lollipop. Also, think about how mean you are to <reading>take</reading> the lollipop away from a defenseless bamboo shrub in the first place!"
4	字	Letter,Character,Symbol	Roof,Child	宀,子	"The <radical>roof</radical> <radical>child</radical> stands upon the roof, holding up a single <kanji>letter</kanji>, a single <kanji>character</kanji>, a single <kanji>symbol</kanji> for the world to see.<br><br>

- Hint: More people can see this character since the kid is on the roof."	<reading><jp>じ</jp></reading>	None	None	じ	"The <kanji>character</kanji> that is being shown is ""J,"" which stands for <reading>Je</reading>sus (<jp>じ</jp>). The kid wants everyone to see this <kanji>letter</kanji> and <kanji>symbol</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the child holding up the letter yelling at everyone who passes that the ""J"" stands for ""Jesus."" And yes, this kid just loves the Big Lebowski."
