Imagine riding your scooter to the barracks. It literally drops you on the ground when you get there, and then drives in reverse back the opposite way you came.	"Your scooter going in <kanji>reverse</kanji> and leaving you here is <kanji>opposite</kanji> of what you want.

The canopy just protects your car from the elements as it sits in storage for long periods of time.	Your car is in this <kanji>storage</kanji> <kanji>warehouse</kanji>, just sitting there. A <ja><reading>子</reading></ja> (<ja>こ</ja>) notices this, and decides to take your car on a joyride. You won't notice, right? You never drive it.	Imagine a kid sneaking into your canopy to steal your car that's in storage. Maybe it's two <ja>子</ja>s, one stacked on the other with a trench coat.

You’re old and want young legs to carry you around, so you took your wishing stick that’s powered by the sun, and you wished for the legs of a child.	Imagine yourself getting new legs. Legs that belong to a child. They’re limber and young and full of energy! Feel your legs of a child underneath you!	As you delight in your new legs, <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>) descends from the sky. “My <kanji>child</kanji>,” he says, “why have you pointed the stick at the sun and wished for the legs of a child? You were already perfect, just as all of God’s children are perfect.”	Say back to Jesus, “I’m not your child Jesus! And you’re just jealous of my new legs! You wish you had the legs of a child, Jesus! Your legs are like super old!” Actually say this out loud, and remember how Jesus wishes he could be a child again too.		4322	-	kanji Lesson_28

Of course, your ice orders are to make things <kanji>cool</kanji> and <kanji>cold</kanji>.	Making things cool and cold are pretty much the only orders you'll hear from ice. Ice is very simple in that regard.	How will you make things <kanji>cool</kanji> and <kanji>cold</kanji>? You'll use a special <reading>ray</reading> (<ja>れい</ja>) gun that shoots a cold ray.	"Imagine a cold ray coming out of your ray gun. Anything it touches becomes cold. ""Stay cool, bird boy,"" you say.

It’s so frozen, it’s like it was frozen once and then frozen again. Twice frozen. Feel the ice and how freezing cold it is. It’s super cold, guys.	Japan is a country in the east, and this ice was <kanji>frozen</kanji> in <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. <ja>とうきょう</ja> is really good at freezing frozen things, so it makes sense that this frozen ice came from there.

In <kanji>infancy</kanji>, one eats a lot of soft foods, such as <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>). Yogurt is the food item above all others that grants superior pooping power.

Adult turkeys should be eating healthier things, like insects and grass. But immature turkeys don't care if they get fat, so they whine and whine and whine until you give them grains.	Imagine an immature turkey complaining at you until you give it grains. Now it's taking selfies with the grains and posting pics to Instagram and hashtagging them #GRAINLIFE.	Another thing <kanji>immature</kanji> turkeys (and people) love is <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>). Most of us non-immature people and birds still like cheese, but if you didn't have an immature cheese phase as a kid or teen, you won't be able to like cheese as a mature old person.

This winter table is something you have to <kanji>deal with</kanji>, sure, but what if you just gave it to a circus <reading>show</reading> (<ja>しょ</ja>)? They like weird stuff like this.

Since Wolverine is actually a mutant, he is soon disqualified from his gold medal. His father makes a <kanji>record</kanji> of this also.

Of course, you need to imagine pulling the Grain Mouth King's finger, to some extent. You can't just read what we write for you, without going to the imagination zone. Pull that finger real hard a couple times, and watch an extra large purge of grain pour forth.	The <kanji>extent</kanji> to which we were harvesting grain from his mouth was too great. The Grain Mouth King has run out of grain. He worries he will lose power if he has no grain to offer, so he switches to barfing out <reading>ta</reading>ter (<ja>てい</ja>) tots instead.	Imagine hearing the rumors that the Grain Mouth King ran out of grain, so you go check the extent of his failure yourself. But tater tots taste pretty good too.

As you <kanji>line up</kanji> these horns and stick them into the ground, you notice a bull munching on <reading>hay</reading> (<ja>へい</ja>) nearby. It's staring at the horns you're lining up.

傘	Kanji	<i class=radical-hat></i>, 人, 十	Hat, Person, Cross	radical, radical, radical	Umbrella	Umbrella		さん	<reading>かさ</reading>			かさ	さん								As a <radical>hat</radical>, <radical>four people</radical> holding a <radical>cross</radical> use an <kanji>umbrella</kanji>. The umbrella is big enough to be a hat for all four people, so it makes sense. All four of them are religious missionaries, so that’s why they’re holding the cross.	See these four people all under one umbrella. No one is carrying the umbrella, it’s just resting on all of their heads like a hat. Their hands are busy holding that cross, anyway.	You know the Spanish phrase “Mi <reading>casa</reading> (<ja>かさ</ja>) es su casa”? Well this is kind of like that, but only with a hat. And that hat is an <kanji>umbrella</kanji>. Mi casa es yours too, because it’s an umbrella and also a hat. This makes sense, trust me.	Imagine the four people in the umbrella hat again, only this time imagine them skipping along singing “Mi casa es su casa”. It’ll help you remember.		4348	-	kanji Lesson_28

The tsunami was pretty violent, and it looks like this axe got blown into some fish and cut off their fins and now those things are just on the ground by the beach.	See these things on the beach. It makes sense to see fins, as fins are usually in the ocean, so seeing them on the beach is logical. Pick up the stuff you find as you feel the beach sand between your toes.	Walking down the <kanji>beach</kanji> a bit more, you also find a <reading>hammer</reading> (<ja>はま</ja>). Gosh, looks like the tsunami hit a workshop or a hardware store or something.
