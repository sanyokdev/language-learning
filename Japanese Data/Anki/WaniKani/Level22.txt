You can't seem to get the guard to stop <kanji>undress</kanji>ing so you throw some <reading>darts</reading> (<ja>だつ</ja>) at him. You figure that even if the guard doesn't snap out of this weird sleepy trance, at least you can use the darts to stick his clothes to his body. Then maybe he won't be able to undress anymore.

Then you might be a <kanji>monk</kanji>. Monks have amazing skills like that. And I'm sure you've seen monks wandering around in lots of media. They don't need maps or smartphones. They just look at the dirt and let the earth guide them to where they need to be.	Picture a monk walking through a large field in the middle of nowhere. He knows where to go, he's not afraid. The dirt will lead him in the right direction.	You want to know the <kanji>monk</kanji>'s trick so you hide behind him for a while as he walks. Finally the monk stops, looks around, takes out a <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) ball and starts bowling in the dirt.

It is indeed just a roof over a bathtub, but I guess spirits inhabit everything according to Shintoism, so there's no reason this bathtub can't be a Shinto shrine too.	"What god does this <kanji>Shinto shrine</kanji> hold? You see that ""It's a-<reading>me-ya</reading>! (Mario!)"""	"It makes sense, the person who says ""It's-a-me!

Actually, <kanji>each</kanji> of your best pals are of the <reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>) variety. By that, I mean they are both roosters. Imagine kissing both of these cocks on their beaks.

Picture a tree coming up with some elaborate plans to make sure they can spend as little money as possible.	The cheap tree's <kanji>plan</kanji> involves only buying <reading>an</reading>chovies (<ja>あん</ja>) and surviving on them. Good exposure to the sun and fresh water is too expensive.

Shellfish used to be used as currency, so they're like the coins that go with dollars.	Imagine opening your bank account and looking at all of your monthly expenses. Now drag the little dollar and shellfish icons over to cover all of those costs.	What is the biggest <kanji>expense</kanji> and <kanji>cost</kanji>?

That's the amazing effect of a good leader.	Can you understand the value of this helicopter? The leader flew it to war and back! So of course it's worth a lot!	To further increase the helicopter's <kanji>value</kanji>, the leader bought himself a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>) and then tied them together. Now it has the value of a helicopter AND a car!

Now pretend you are the pregnant woman.

The frozen <kanji>condition</kanji> of this dog was caused by <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>), the local farmhand. He forgot to let the dog back inside, and then it froze.	But, did Jourm forget? We all know he's a bit clumsy and slow, but he's been letting the dog inside for years now. Would he really do this by accident?

While you may have the <kanji>appearance</kanji> of someone who is super strong, powerful, and awesome, you do have one shortcoming. You don’t know how to <reading>tie</reading> (<ja>たい</ja>) a tie.
