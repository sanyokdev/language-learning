The shrimp also tells the time right at noon, every day (so important you stress remembering that it's noon, not some other time). Maybe you could have him sing a ""noon song"" in your imagination as well."	Kanji Meaning	-	Kanji_Meaning Level_15 Genki_L13

So, focus on the fact that this is some kind of indication that's important, but you don't know what that indication means or is... because we'll use that with the reading.

That is not a ceremony. A ceremony has a past. A ceremony is done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a <kanji>ritual</kanji> first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish ceremony.<br><br>  This kanji also means <kanji>equation</kanji> for some reason too.
