偉	Kanji	ｲ, 韋	Leader, Korea	radical, radical	Greatness	Greatness		<reading>い</reading>	えら			い	えら								The <radical>leader</radical> of <radical>Korea</radical> is destined for <kanji>greatness</kanji>.	I mean, they're the leader of Korea already, right? So they have to have a decent chunk of greatness in them already to get that far.	The <kanji>greatness</kanji> radiates off of the leader of Korea, so much so that you can hardly look. Just when you're about to close your eyes to shield them from the greatness, a great <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) soars over them, letting out a cry.	Picture the greatness of the scene before you: the leader of Korea, a great eagle overhead, it's so great!!		7665	-	kanji Lesson_51
頂	Kanji	丁, 頁	Street, Geoduck	radical, radical	Summit, Humbly	Summit, Humbly		<reading>ちょう</reading>	いただき いただ			ちょう	いただき, いただ								Take the <radical>street</radical> all the way to that <radical>geoduck</radical>, way up there. When you reach it, you will have made it to the <kanji>summit</kanji>. You <kanji>humbly</kanji> present the road to the geoduck and bow before it.	There is a giant geoduck at the summit of the mountain, and the street will lead you right there. Imagine the grueling climb up the mountain to the summit. Feel it in your legs, and keep looking at that tall, tall geoduck. Now imagine kneeling those same aching legs humbly to the street below the geoduck.	You are at the top, the <kanji>summit</kanji> of everything! You <kanji>humbly</kanji> survey your surroundings from the top of the geoduck, only to see someone on the street, running toward you. It is Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>), and she looks angry.	Anytime you use the street, you're in Mrs. Chou's territory. After detecting you were using her street to reach the geoduck, she started coming after you. Remember, wherever there's a street (radical), Mrs. Chou is not far behind.		7666	-	kanji Lesson_51
召	Kanji	召	Call	radical	Call, Eat	Call, Eat		<reading>しょう</reading>	め			しょう	め								The <radical>call</radical> radical and the <kanji>call</kanji> kanji are the same. This kanji can also mean <kanji>eat</kanji>, because why would you call someone if not to ask them to eat with you?!	Call your mom or dad and ask them to go out to eat with you right now.	You are <kanji>call</kanji>ed to come <kanji>eat</kanji> by the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>). He's been really impressed with you lately and he wants to chat over drinks, he says on the phone.	Imagine getting a call from the Shougun himself. He's come to your house before, but he's never asked you to eat with him. This is huge!		7667	-	kanji Lesson_51

Old trees' roots and leaves grow inefficient, and they can't get enough nutrients. It's only natural for them to wither up a little bit.	This <kanji>wither</kanji>ed tree's best friend is a human <ja><reading>子</reading></ja> (<ja>こ</ja>). Imagine the child hugging the tree.	It gave the <ja>子</ja> its shade, its sap, and eventually its body to build a house. What an awful child, and what a generic giving tree.		7669	-	kanji Lesson_51

Imagine standing in front of an incoming tsunami. Suddenly in the distance you see someone throwing dollar bills into it and it starts to boil. Ahh!	The <kanji>boil</kanji>ing water crashes onto the land and you realize your foot is in it! No, not one foot, both your <reading>foots</reading> (<ja>ふつ</ja>)! It hurts so much that you can't even remember the word for two foots.	Feel your poor little foots burn in the boiling water. You really want to know who that jerk was that threw dollars into the tsunami to make it boil!		7670	-	kanji Lesson_51
濯	Kanji	氵, ヨ, 隹	Tsunami, Wolverine, Turkey	radical, radical, radical	Wash	Wash		<reading>たく</reading>	すす ゆす そそぐ			たく	すす, ゆす, そそぐ								You need to throw your two <radical>wolverine</radical>s and your <radical>turkey</radical> into the oncoming <radical>tsunami</radical> if you want to <kanji>wash</kanji> them at the same time. It's the only way you can get them clean at once without the wolverines fighting over the turkey and somebody getting hurt. The tsunami is big enough to wash them all before anything bad happens.	Imagine the tsunami coming toward you. Two wolverines in one hand and a turkey in the other. You're gonna wash them so good they'll never get dirty again.	Once they're nice and <kanji>wash</kanji>ed you need to subdue them by poking each of them with a <reading>tack</reading> (<ja>たく</ja>). The tack has special sleeping medicine on it, so once they're nice and clean you can put them back in their cages without them trying to eat each other.	If you want to wash your animals make sure to have your special tack ready. The tsunami will recede pretty fast so get it out!		7671	-	kanji Lesson_51
燥	Kanji	火, 喿	Fire, Syrup	radical, radical	Dry Up	Dry Up		<reading>そう</reading>	はしゃ			そう	はしゃ								Put <radical>syrup</radical> too close to <radical>fire</radical> and it will <kanji>dry up</kanji>. Put any liquid substance near fire and it will dry up actually, but syrup especially. It goes from being sticky and gooey and yummy to a pile of hard, dry sugar. Not so yummy.	Imagine putting some syrup over a fire and watching it dry up. Watch as the sides slowly bubble and harden and lose what makes syrup so good in the first place.	If you <kanji>dry up</kanji> syrup like this, you're removing its <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Have you ever seen dry syrup before? No soul in that. In fact, you probably have no soul if you can dry out syrup like this without feeling bad about it.	Go back to imagining a fire drying up some syrup and watch as a tiny little syrup soul cries and is released into the air. Oh no!		7672	-	kanji Lesson_51

You get closer and realize it's not a lantern, it's a <kanji>bottle</kanji>. It's got horns, and a weird handle, but it's definitely a bottle with water inside of it.	Picture this horned bottle sitting on the ground. You don't know who left it here or why, but it's here and the weirdest looking bottle you've ever seen.	Even though you're not the one who left this <kanji>bottle</kanji> here, you decide to do the right thing and throw it in the trash <reading>bin</reading> (<ja>びん</ja>). It's not right to leave a bottle just sitting on the ground, you know.	Imagine picking up this weird bottle with your bare hands and putting it in a trash bin. You did your good deed for today! Yay!		7673	-	kanji Lesson_51

These are the two things you need in order to <kanji>plow</kanji>.	You'd think you'd only need a plow, but you also need water if you're going to plow a field, otherwise what's the point?	<kanji>plow</kanji>ing all the fields are <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>s. Not Emperor <ja>こういち</ja>. These are the <ja>こういち</ja> clones the government made, and now they're being put to use.	Thousands and thousands of <ja>こういち</ja>s, set free unto the world to do all our <kanji>plow</kanji>ing work.		7674	-	kanji Lesson_51

That, at least, we can come to an <kanji>agreement</kanji> on.	There are a group of people pointing at pictures of the moon coming closer to earth. They are the world's leaders, and although they don't get along normally, this new attack from the moon has united them in agreement: we must stop the moon.	"""We have <kanji>agreement</kanji>,"" the world's leaders all say. ""We will work together to stop the moon, and we have <kanji>agreement</kanji> on who we will follow, Emperor <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>."	The world has united against the moon, and they have made Emperor <ja>こういち</ja> their temporary leader.		7675	-	kanji Lesson_51
脂	Kanji	月, 匕, 日	Moon, Spoon, Sun	radical, radical, radical	Fat	Fat		<reading>し</reading>	あぶら			し	あぶら								If you eat both the <radical>moon</radical> and the <radical>sun</radical> with a <radical>spoon</radical> you'll get <kanji>fat</kanji>. Maybe if you only ate one you could get away with it, but you wanted both and now you're pretty fat.	Picture yourself digging your spoon into the moon, then into the sun, and gulping them both down. Watch your stomach swell with the sun and moon fats. No going back now, gotta finish.	Once you're nice and <kanji>fat</kanji>, you look in the mirror to admire your new girth. But that's not you... it's a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>)!	Oh nooo you've turned into a fat sheep!

膚	Kanji	虍, 胃	Tiger, Stomach	radical, radical	Skin	Skin		<reading>ふ</reading>	はだ			ふ	はだ								If you look in a <radical>tiger</radical>'s <radical>stomach</radical> you'll find a bunch of <kanji>skin</kanji>. It's really gross but what else did you think you'd find? Everyone knows tigers can't digest the skin of the things it eats. 	Imagine yourself opening a tigers mouth and looking all the way down into its stomach and seeing a bunch of skin. Why would you imagine that? Eww.	The only person who would try to take <kanji>skin</kanji> from a tiger's stomach is a <reading>foo</reading>l (<ja>ふ</ja>). You'll probably get your head bitten off looking for skin that way.  	Imagine a fool trying to pull skin out of a tiger's stomach. You can imagine them getting their skin added to the pile too if you want.		7677	-	kanji Lesson_51
軒	Kanji	車, 干	Car, Dry	radical, radical	House Counter, Eaves	House Counter, Eaves		<reading>けん</reading>	のき			けん	のき								Your <radical>car</radical> is <radical>dry</radical> because you kept it under the <kanji>eaves</kanji> of your house.   This kanji has a second meaning too: <kanji>house counter</kanji>. Imagine counting all the houses on your block by the number of eaves you see keeping cars dry.	One eave, one house. Two eaves, two houses.	On top of the <kanji>eaves</kanji> of your house <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>) the samurai is counting houses too.	Ken hops down and explains that he's been hired to count all the houses in his lord's domain just because his name is the same as the counter for houses. It isn't really fair, he complains to you, as you try to sneak by and lock him out of your house.		7678	-	kanji Lesson_51
軟	Kanji	車, 欠	Car, Lack	radical, radical	Soft	Soft		<reading>なん</reading>	やわ			なん	やわ								A <radical>car</radical> that's <radical>lack</radical>ing is really <kanji>soft</kanji>. Cars need to be hard so that things like bugs and other cars wont hurt the people inside when you hit them. But if your car is lacking the hardness it needs, you'll have a really soft, useless car.	Picture a soft car lacking what it needs to drive down the road. It's so soft it just flops down and won't move.	This car is probably so <kanji>soft</kanji> because it's made entirely of <reading>naan</reading> (<ja>なん</ja>). Naan may be delicious, but it makes a really crappy car. No wonder it was so soft (and yummy).	Picture trying to drive this soft naan car. It probably just sinks into the ground and then gets eaten by wild animals (and me).		7679	-	kanji Lesson_51

So what?	Imagine a huge splinter coming out of the corner of the building. It's in a really dangerous spot, but the owner doesn't seem so worried about it.	That <kanji>corner</kanji> is dangerous, but what are you going to do, <reading>sue me</reading> (<ja>すみ</ja>)?	Actually, please don't sue me.

That's why the universal <kanji>ship counter</kanji> is a turkey on a stool. Not a crow.	Picture yourself counting ships by pointing your finger from one turkey propped up on a stool to the next. You'll be the best ship counter in the world at this rate!	Once you become the best <kanji>ship counter</kanji> in the world everyone will think you are super <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>)! Nothing is sexier than being able to count, and counting ships is the sexiest thing you can count.	Imagine yourself, a sexy ship counter. Sexily counting ships. You go guy/girl/non binary person!

If it was in your county then it wouldn't be a buddy, it would be a neighbor. You're aware of this building, but they aren't that close, so they're just a buddy.	Imagine looking at a map of your county and the surrounding ones. All of the buildings in the counties next to yours are buddy buildings!	Your <kanji>county</kanji> is everything you can reach when shooting a <reading>gun</reading> (<ja>ぐん</ja>). If the bullet can't reach a building you know, it's a buddy building in another county.	Imagine taking out a gun and shooting in a random direction. When you find where the bullet landed, you know that's the county line.
