誤	Kanji	言, 呉	Say, Catapult	radical, radical	Mistake	Mistake		<reading>ご</reading>	あやま			ご	あやま								They <radical>say</radical> accidentally firing a <radical>catapult</radical> is an unforgivable <kanji>mistake</kanji>. They say you shot the catapult at your own castle. Even though it was an accident, it’s still a mistake you will never be forgiven for.	Imagine shooting the catapult on your own people by mistake. Hear the catapult whoosh as your heart drops into your stomach. Oh, what a terrible mistake you’ve just made.	This <kanji>mistake</kanji> alerts <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>), who thinks it's town destroying time. He barrels over the hills, sees where you mistakenly catapulted your own people, and proceeds to stomp on the rest of it for you.	Picture Godzilla jumping happily on the castle and surrounding town you hit by mistake. This is probably the worst mistake you've ever made.		5215	-	kanji Lesson_34
臓	Kanji	月, 蔵	Moon, Storehouse	radical, radical	Internal Organs	Internal Organs		<reading>ぞう</reading>				ぞう									Your <radical>moon</radical> <radical>storehouse</radical> is another storehouse you own. Remember how your regular storehouse holds zombies (from the kanji <ja>蔵</ja>?). Your moon storehouse is on the moon, and it is filled with <kanji>internal organs</kanji>.	Your moon storehouse has internal organs because 1) you have to keep them far away from the zombies or they'll go berserk, and 2) you think it's funny to see them bounce around in low gravity. Boing, boing, boing, haha look at that internal organ.	Where did you get all these <kanji>internal organ</kanji>s from? You actually harvested them from the <reading>zo</reading>mbies (<ja>ぞう</ja>) from your other storehouse. 	Basically, you store zombies in your regular storehouse, harvest their organs, then launch them into space where they are put into a storehouse on the moon where the zombies will never be able to find them again.		5216	-	kanji Lesson_34

You want to get the <kanji>valuable</kanji> thing from inside the shellfish, but it's locked and you need to find the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). Search for the key!

You lost a drop of rice from your rice bowl. Feel sorrow for the lost rice as you watch it fall down the well and hear it splat into the water below.	Just then, the <reading>don</reading> (<ja>どん</ja>) of your local mafia shows up, steals your <kanji>rice bowl</kanji>, and shoves you into the well.

"When you <kanji>throw up</kanji> it sounds like you're shouting, ""<reading>HA</reading> (<ja>は</ja>)!"" Then all the dirt-puke comes out in a wave.

All these things tell you that this samurai is actually a <kanji>slave</kanji>.	Traditionally, samurai don't carry things like jackhammers, brushes, or water. The samurai is carrying these things for someone else, meaning this samurai is somebody's slave.	You don't like seeing a <kanji>slave</kanji>. As you walk by, you hand him a <reading>ray</reading> (<ja>れい</ja>) gun so he can free himself.	The samurai slave can use the ray gun to shoot his keeper and get away.

Potatoes grow when flowers dry out. All the nutrients are going to the potato under the ground, so the flowers up top get sucked dry.	<kanji>Potato</kanji>es are totally <reading>emo</reading> (<ja>いも</ja>) because of the way they dry out flowers.

If you build it out of clay or bricks or wood, it will inevitably have some dirt in it. Build it out of thread to keep it pure of... well, impurities.	Imagine a barracks pure white, like pure snow, made of pure thread.	This <kanji>pure</kanji> thread barracks can only be used in <reading>June</reading> (<ja>じゅん</ja>), unfortunately. Any other time of year there will be snow and rain and mud and that will get tracked into the pure barracks and ruin them. But June is the cleanest, most pure month, so you can use it then.

Look at this vertical thread as it hangs from the horns. Take hold of it and pull on the vertical thread. Feel it in your hand.

It’s also <kanji>stylish</kanji> to <reading>swi</reading>ng (<ja>すい</ja>) the cross around while you wait for things. You’re waiting at a bus stop so you swing the cross around violently.

The color of the thread is a <kanji>deep red</kanji>, and it gives everything a <kanji>crimson</kanji> look.	Because thread isn't that strong, you have to use A LOT (to hold things like beams in place). So, the deep red / crimson thread actually stands out a lot in this construction project.	You're done, and the whole building is a <kanji>deep red</kanji> <kanji>crimson</kanji> color (it takes a lot of thread to hold a whole building in place).

Whether it's for a photo shoot, you're gonna shoot them with a gun, or if you're about to shoot them full of radiation for X-rays, you need the right measurements of that body first.	Imagine someone measuring your body before they shoot you. You hope it's the good kind of shoot and that you're not going to die.	This <kanji>shoot</kanji> is being done by a <reading>sha</reading>man (<ja>しゃ</ja>).

Imagine hanging towels over all the windows in the greenhouse. They're really fuzzy, thick curtains now.	You're hanging these towel <kanji>curtain</kanji>s because you need a quiet place to eat a Big <reading>Mac</reading> (<ja>まく</ja>). But you're a little ashamed.

You were able to <kanji>infer</kanji> the turkey's plan, so now it's your turn. You look around and see the only way out... is to <reading>swi</reading>ng (<ja>すい</ja>) to safety!
