Imagine someone close to you experiencing the death of their heart. They look right at you but they've already started to forget everything. I know this is not a fun thing to imagine, but use that emotion to help you remember this kanji, not forget it.	When someone <kanji>forget</kanji>s everything they're left with only one thing to do: go <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>). Bowling is easy, and there's nothing to forget. You pick up a ball.

脳	Kanji	月, <i class=radical-grass></i>, 凶	Moon, Grass, Treasure Chest	radical, radical, radical	Brain	Brain		<reading>のう</reading>				のう									Nestled in the light of the <radical>moon</radical> in the <radical>grass</radical> is a <radical>treasure chest</radical> that you can see with your <kanji>brain</kanji>. You close your eyes, and you can see the spot, but it's kept deep in your brain, and you have to use its power to find it.	As you visualize the treasure chest you realize that the moon was your face, the grass your hair, and the treasure chest your brain! It was you all along!	If you can unlock the secrets of your <kanji>brain</kanji> you'll have powers like <reading>No</reading>stradamus (<ja>のう</ja>). Nostradamus was able to look inward at his own hidden brain treasure chest and see the future, so maybe you can be like him too.	Use your brain like Nostradamus and try to see the future.

You don’t know, their face is covered by a mask!	Picture this leader in their mask. Listen to them chant prayers that reverberate throughout the building.	This <kanji>monk</kanji> or <kanji>priest</kanji> is wearing a mask to protect their <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). You aren't a monk or a priest, so they don't want your not-religious-enough eyes to dirty their soul.	Imagine the monk/priest's bright, pure soul shining behind the mask. You'll never actually see it, unless you're becoming a monk/priest yourself, and then your soul will need protecting too.		2805	-	kanji Lesson_18

Zen is all about meditating and letting earthly things go. There's nothing more simple for your spirit than being <kanji>Zen</kanji>.	Try out Zen meditation for a little bit. Look away from your computer or phone or tablet and let your life be simple for a second. Just let it all go and free your spirit from all the noise.	The reading for this kanji is <reading>Zen</reading> (<ja>ぜん</ja>), just like the <kanji>Zen</kanji> in <kanji>Zen Buddhism</kanji>. Pretty easy to remember, no? Just remember that the reading is the same as the meaning. It’s easy!	Without a new reading to learn, you should have time to close your eyes and clear your mind.

可	Kanji	可	Lip Ring	radical	Possible, Passable	Possible, Passable		<reading>か</reading>				か									With a <radical>lip ring</radical>, anything is <kanji>possible</kanji>. Having a lip ring grants you the power to conquer any obstacle, achieve any goal. As long as it's a <kanji>passable</kanji> lip ring, that is. If it isn't good enough, it isn't possible to be passable.	Imagine getting a magical lip ring. First, you have to find a passable one. Then, you have to go through the pain of having your lip pierced. Is it even possible to imagine how painful that would be?!	Since anything and everything is <kanji>possible</kanji> with your new <kanji>passable</kanji> lip ring, you use it to get a new <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>). You go to the car dealership and ask for a free (passable) car. The manager is impressed with your lip ring and gladly hands over the keys to the latest model of your favorite car. Not bad.	It was possible to get this passable car thanks to your lip ring. Hooray!		2807	-	kanji Lesson_18
許	Kanji	言, 午	Say, Noon	radical, radical	Permit, Allow	Permit, Allow		<reading>きょ</reading>	ゆる			きょ	ゆる								<radical>Say</radical> it at <radical>noon</radical>. That's the only time I will <kanji>allow</kanji> you to say it. That's the only time I will <kanji>permit</kanji> you to say it. Other than that, no saying anything. Noon is your window.	Imagine a world where you're not allowed to say anything except for at noon. At that moment, after you've been staring at the clock, waiting for that opportunity, you burst forth with things you want to say. But, once it hits 12:01, you are grabbed and your mouth is covered. You are not permitted to say anything outside of that time.	Where do these archaic horrible rules exist? The smaller version of Kyoto, Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょ</ja>). Normal Kyoto is just fine. This smaller one is where a group of people went to create their own little town with their own dumb rules.	Imagine going to big Kyoto where everything is fine. Then, go to little Kyoto where it's not. Little Kyoto has the short <ja>きょ</ja> (instead of the long one), and this is how you can remember the difference.		2808	-	kanji Lesson_18
枚	Kanji	木, 夂	Tree, Winter	radical, radical	Flat Objects Counter, Flat Object, Counter For Flat Objects	Flat Objects Counter, Flat Object, Counter For Flat Objects		<reading>まい</reading>				まい									In the <radical>winter</radical>, one can use a sliced up <radical>tree</radical> as a <kanji>flat objects counter</kanji>. Since it’s winter, all the leaves have fallen off the tree, so it’s easy to cut into slats. These slats can be used as counters for flat objects, such as these slats.	Imagine yourself counting these flat objects in winter. It’s super cold, but you have to count them. How many are there?	While trying to count these slats of wood, a whole bunch of <reading>mi</reading>ce (<ja>まい</ja>) show up and start climbing all over the tree. This will not do, so you take two slats and start smashing and flattening all the mice. Now that the mice are flat too, you can also use them as a <kanji>flat objects counter</kanji>. Good job, mice.	Now imagine yourself counting on these mice you just smashed. They’re freshly dead, so there’s not much of a stench yet, but you still feel bad about using dead mice to help you count. Imagine yourself counting on these mice as you try to hold back tears from all the murder you just did.		2809	-	kanji Lesson_18
静	Kanji	青, 争	Blue, Conflict	radical, radical	Quiet	Quiet		<reading>せい</reading>	しず			せい	しず								<radical>Conflict</radical> in <radical>blue</radical> water is made <kanji>quiet</kanji> by the muffling power of water. Under this blue water is a great conflict between two sea monsters, but on the surface it appears peaceful and quiet as the water prevents sound from rising above the surface.	Imagine watching this conflict from above the blue water on a boat. You can kind of see the action, but you can't hear a thing.	As you watch below the <kanji>quiet</kanji> water, every once in a while a <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) breaches the surface and quietly slices back down.	Sabers are sharp, curved, and totally quiet. Great for underwater blue conflicts, and sneaky assassinations. 		2810	-	kanji Lesson_18

禁	Kanji	木, 示	Tree, Jackhammer	radical, radical	Prohibit, Prohibition	Prohibit, Prohibition		<reading>きん</reading>				きん									Killing two <radical>tree</radical>s with a <radical>jackhammer</radical> is expressly <kanji>prohibit</kanji>ed. Don't get me wrong, you can rip up one tree with your jackhammer, but not two.	Imagine standing in front of a forest with your jackhammer, staring at a sign with just this kanji on it. Tree plus tree with jackhammer equals prohibited. Hmm.	The person who decided to <kanji>prohibit</kanji> jackhammering two trees is the <reading>Kin</reading>g (<ja>きん</ja>) of England. He's the only person who's able to prohibit certain things, so it had to be him.	Picture the King angrily covering his ears as his subjects jackhammer trees. He screams and shouts, his crown bouncing on his head, and points at his new sign that prohibits the jackhammering of trees.		2812	-	kanji Lesson_18

You put it all the way down there, so you <kanji>consume</kanji> it.	"Imagine yourself doing a magic trick where you put a big sword in your mouth. You say: ""Now, for my next illusion, I will consume a sword!"""	"The ""<kanji>consume</kanji> a sword"" illusion came with a cheap magic <reading>kit</reading> (<ja>きつ</ja>) you had."

This causes <kanji>smoke</kanji> from the fire and the dirt to spread everywhere! It's in your eyes, your mouth, your ears! The smoke gets in your lungs and you can't breathe. Why helicopter, why!	Imagine the smoke stopping up your lungs and getting in your eyes. All you know other than the smoke is the sound of the helicopter that's causing it to happen.	The <kanji>smoke</kanji> is too much and you realize this is the <reading>en</reading>d (<ja>えん</ja>) for you. You're gonna die here!	Imagine choking on the smoke and accepting that this is the end. Boohoo, if only you'd learned more kanji before the end!		2814	-	kanji Lesson_18

Imagine the arrow with its hook shooting down into your mouth and hooking into your throat. Ouch! Now the leader is peering down in there, but you don't know why.	From your <kanji>throat</kanji> you hear a voice. Not yours, but one you recognize. It's <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>! What's that rascal doing down in your throat?	"The leader starts to tug <ja>こういち</ja> out of your throat, but he resists. ""No, I like it down here, it's dark and damp."" The leader gets angry and pulls harder, which hurts! This is your throat, after all, don't you get a say?!"		2815	-	kanji Lesson_18

The stamp looks like a little drum, but you're really just hitting your mouth for fun (the stamp was an excuse to make it seem normal).	Put a stamp on your mouth and look in your bathroom mirror. Now strike that stamp and make a fresh new beat the young kids can dance to!	"As you <kanji>strike</kanji> and <kanji>beat</kanji> your own mouth, <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja> comes dancing into your bathroom. ""Hey now, this looks fun, can I beat your mouth up a bit too?"" he asks."	<ja>こういち</ja> doesn't wait for you to remove the stamp to answer, and instead starts striking your mouth to make his own beats.

Picture your mouth opening and closing really fast and hard as candy on a conveyor belt goes sliding in. Munch, munch, munch, you're a candy machine!	This <kanji>candy</kanji> in particular is just drops of hardened, clear sugar that looks like <reading><ja>雨</ja></reading> (<ja>あめ</ja>) drops.
