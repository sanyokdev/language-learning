_x000D_
When <jp>間</jp> refers to a longer interval of time, it's generally read as <jp>あいだ</jp>. For a short burst of time, it's read as <jp>ま</jp>. When it means an interval of space, it's usually read as <jp>あいだ</jp>. <br><br>_x000D_

You can remember this because time feels longer in <reading>Ida</reading>ho (<jp>あいだ</jp>). Any interval of time you spend there feels so long, because Idaho life moves so slowly.

Before you read this PLEASE PLEASE REMEMBER this is NOT a jukugo word. It's weird. You're gonna want to type <jp>ぎんこう</jp> but that's wrong. Stop that now.<br><br>

When you think of a <vocabulary>ginkgo tree</vocabulary> think about this: Ginkgos are a favorite nesting place for <reading>ea</reading>gles but evil Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> likes to eat eagles AND whole gingko trees. She prefers eating eagles WHILE THEY'RE IN THE GINKGO TREES AND ARE STILL ALIVE. So <jp>いちょう</jp>. Eagles and Mrs. Chou. And gingko trees. It's horrible to think about. Just like this reading not being jukugo.<br><br>

The other meaning is the <vocabulary>ginkgo nut</vocabulary>s themselves. They taste like <reading><jp>銀</jp></reading> (<jp>ぎん</jp>) <reading>naan</reading> (<jp>なん</jp>).
