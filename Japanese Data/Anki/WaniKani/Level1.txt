一	Radical				Ground	Ground															This radical consists of a single, horizontal stroke. What's the biggest, single, horizontal stroke? That's the <radical>ground</radical>. Look at the ground, look at this radical, now look at the ground again. Kind of the same, right?					1	-	Lesson_1 radical
ハ	Radical				Fins	Fins															Picture a fish. Now picture the fish a little worse, like a child's drawing of the fish. Now erase the fish's body and... you're left with two <radical>fins</radical>! Do you see these two fins? Yeah, you see them.					2	-	Lesson_1 radical
丶	Radical				Drop	Drop															This little radical is a <radical>drop</radical> of water or some other liquid. Notice how it's only one drop? Sometimes radicals or kanji will have more than one drop, so it's important that you know how to tell them apart.					3	-	Lesson_1 radical
丿	Radical				Slide	Slide															Close your eyes and imagine you're a kid again. Now open them and... look! It's a <radical>slide</radical>! Imagine little you sliding down this slide over and over, having a great time. Imagination + emotion makes for good memorization!					4	-	Lesson_1 radical
亅	Radical				Barb	Barb															"This radical is shaped like a <radical>barb</radical>. Like the kind you'd see on barb wire. Imagine one of these getting stuck to your arm or your clothes. Think about how much it would hurt with that little hook on the end sticking into you. Say out loud, ""Oh dang, I got a barb stuck in me!"""					5	-	Lesson_1 radical
二	Radical				Two	Two, 2															One line plus another line equals <radical>two</radical> lines. This radical represents the number two. Pretty simple, right? Can you guess what three looks like? I bet you can...					6	-	Lesson_1 radical
亠	Radical				Lid	Lid															This looks like something you'd put on a kettle or a pot, right? It even has a little handle to make sure you don't burn yourself. This is some kind of <radical>lid</radical>.					7	-	Lesson_1 radical
大	Radical				Big	Big															This radical looks just like a stick figure—more specifically, a really <radical>big</radical> guy with his arms stretched out nice and big. When you see this radical, just think big, because this guy is really BIG!					8	-	Lesson_1 radical
人	Radical				Person	Person															If you were to draw a <radical>person</radical> with just strokes like you see in kanji, you'd create a stick figure, maybe something like this: <ja>大</ja>. But this is just a person, not someone holding out their arms to show how big they are. So their arms are down, which makes them look like a torso with a pair of legs. Maybe they're walking too, which is why their legs are spread out like that. You can see the person now, can't you?					9	-	Lesson_1 radical
入	Radical				Enter	Enter															Watch out! This isn't the person radical, it's something else. What's the difference? The right side is longer than the left side. And on computers, it usually has that extra part sticking out of the top. It kind of looks like a flap opening to a teepee. And what do you do with an opening? You enter it! That's why this radical is <radical>enter</radical>.					10	-	Lesson_1 radical
力	Radical				Power	Power															Imagine a guy flexing his arm downward to show off his steroid-pumped arm. It's huge. It's so full of <radical>power</radical>. RARRRWWWRRR!!					11	-	Lesson_1 radical
勹	Radical				Prison	Prison, Enclosure															This looks like an enclosure of sorts - that's why it's a <radical>prison</radical>. It wraps itself around things and locks them in there. Prisons are pretty scary, even before you imagine one slowly floating down from the sky to trap you.					12	-	Lesson_1 radical
口	Radical				Mouth	Mouth															A big, gaping, square hole represents someone opening their giant <radical>mouth</radical> to tell you something stupid.					13	-	Lesson_1 radical
女	Radical				Woman	Woman															This radical looks like a wide person made up of two stacked Xs. Women generally have two XXs for chromosomes, and back in the day they were praised for their wide, child-bearing hips. We may not think of women this way anymore, but way back when Japanese was made, this made them think of a <radical>woman</radical>.					14	-	Lesson_1 radical
七	Radical				Seven	Seven, 7															What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is <radical>seven</radical>, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning!					15	-	Lesson_1 radical
十	Radical				Cross	Cross															This radical looks like a <radical>cross</radical>. I mean, just look at it. Two bars going through each other = a cross!					16	-	Lesson_1 radical
山	Radical				Mountain	Mountain															"This is a <radical>mountain</radical>. You'll have to add the lines that make up the top of the mountain if you want it more ""mountain-like."" Also something that might help: sometimes mountains have a couple of smaller peaks coming out the side of the main peak too. Connect the dots and create the mountain in your mind."					17	-	Lesson_1 radical
川	Radical				River	River															"This radical already looks like a <radical>river</radical>. See the banks of the river on the side and the flow of the river in the middle? There's even a slight turn in the river too. So when you see this radical, you should think ""river."""					18	-	Lesson_1 radical
木	Radical				Tree	Tree															Do you see the <radical>tree</radical> in here? It has branches, and then it has the foliage coming down diagonally from it, spreading out like a tree would. That's why this radical is a tree.					19	-	Lesson_1 radical
工	Radical				Construction	Construction															You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those, and have a very distinct shape, just like this radical. These girders are used in construction, which is why this radical means <radical>construction</radical>. Funny thing is, you use these girders to put together buildings just like you're going to use this radical to put together kanji!					20	-	Lesson_1 radical
九	Radical				Nine	Nine, 9															"If you look at this radical in just the right way, you'll notice that it kind of looks like the letters ""n"" and ""i"" (the ""i"" comes from the little flippy-up stroke on the right side). What do the letters ""n"" and ""i"" start spelling? Why, the word <radical>nine</radical>."					21	-	Lesson_1 radical
<i class=radical-leaf></i>	Radical				Leaf	Leaf															There's a leaf on top and a stem going down out of it, making it the <radical>leaf</radical> radical. It looks kind of like a lilypad, sitting on top of the water with its stem going down to the bottom where the dirt is.					22	-	Lesson_1 radical
<i class=radical-gun></i>	Radical				Gun	Gun															Doesn't this look like a long <radical>gun</radical>? You have a shoulder rest and the barrel. Bam bam bam! Imagine looking down its long barrel at a target. Feel the rest on your shoulder. Now that's a nice gun!					23	-	Lesson_1 radical
日	Radical				Sun	Sun															Since there are no circles in Japanese characters, sometimes rectangles or squares have to make do. In this case, this big rectangle is the <radical>sun</radical>. The middle line going through the center horizontally is the equator. Or maybe it's a cloud, moving across the sun. Picture it, but don't actually look at the sun and burn your eyes!					24	-	Lesson_1 radical
ト	Radical				Toe	Toe															This radical looks just like the katakana character <ja>ト</ja> (to), which sounds like the word <radical>toe</radical>. So when you see <ja>ト</ja>, think toe.					25	-	Lesson_1 radical
<i class=radical-stick></i>	Radical				Stick	Stick															This is a <radical>stick</radical>, sticking out of the ground. It even looks like a stick.					26	-	Lesson_1 radical
一	Kanji	一	Ground	radical	One	One, 1		<reading>いち</reading> <reading>いつ</reading>	ひと	かず		いち, いつ	ひと, かず								Lying on the <radical>ground</radical> is something that looks just like the ground, the number <kanji>One</kanji>. Why is this One lying down? It's been shot by the number two. It's lying there, bleeding out and dying. The number One doesn't have long to live.	"To remember the meaning of <kanji>One</kanji>, imagine yourself there at the scene of the crime. You grab <kanji>One</kanji> in your arms, trying to prop it up, trying to hear its last words. Instead, it just splatters some blood on your face. ""Who did this to you?"" you ask. The number One points weakly, and you see number Two running off into an alleyway. He's always been jealous of number One and knows he can be number one now that he's taken the real number one out."	As you're sitting there next to <kanji>One</kanji>, holding him up, you start feeling a weird sensation all over your skin. From the wound comes a fine powder (obviously coming from the special bullet used to kill One) that causes the person it touches to get extremely <reading>itchy</reading> (<ja>いち</ja>).	Make sure you feel the ridiculously <reading>itchy</reading> sensation covering your body. It climbs from your hands, where you're holding the number <kanji>One</kanji> up, and then goes through your arms, crawls up your neck, goes down your body, and then covers everything. It becomes uncontrollable, and you're scratching everywhere, writhing on the ground. It's so itchy that it's the most painful thing you've ever experienced (you should imagine this vividly, so you remember the reading of this kanji).		27	-	kanji Lesson_1
二	Kanji	二	Two	radical	Two	Two, 2		<reading>に</reading>	ふた			に	ふた								The kanji <kanji>two</kanji> and the radical <radical>two</radical> are the exact same things. Therefore, you know the kanji for two already!	More simply put, you can just know that this kanji is the double of One. It's two lines, that's not all that hard to remember!	Think of all the things you have <kanji>Two</kanji> of. What is the most important? Some would say eyes, some would say ears. I would say the <reading>knee</reading> (<ja>に</ja>) because if you didn't have them, it'd be really hard to go up stairs.	Imagine yourself without two knees, and see what it would be like. What would give you trouble? What couldn't you do? Just imagining this for a minute or two will help you to remember the reading of this kanji more effectively.		28	-	kanji Lesson_1
九	Kanji	九	Nine	radical	Nine	Nine, 9		<reading>く</reading> <reading>きゅう</reading>	ここの			く, きゅう	ここの								Nice! This kanji is the same as the radical that looks just like it (down to the meaning, even!). The radical is <radical>nine</radical> and the kanji is <kanji>nine</kanji>, making the meaning of this kanji really easy to remember as long as you know the radical first.	If you know your radicals well, this kanji will be a breeze!	Although this kanji has two on'yomi to learn, the pronunciations of those two on'yomi are very similar, so that should make them easier to remember.  When you were <kanji>nine</kanji> your favorite foods were <reading>coo</reading>kies (<ja>く</ja>) and <reading>cu</reading>cumbers (<ja>きゅう</ja>). Yum yum!	Picture nine-year-old you, lining up nine cookies and nine cucumbers. You dip a cookie in milk and bite into it, then dip a cucumber in and take a bite. Nine bites each until they're all gone. Ah, you miss being nine.		29	-	kanji Lesson_1
七	Kanji	七	Seven	radical	Seven	Seven, 7		<reading>しち</reading>	なな なの			しち	なな, なの								Lucky for you (as is the case with many of the lower-stroke kanji), this kanji is the same as the radical you've already learned. The radical that makes up this kanji is <radical>seven</radical> and the kanji (which is exactly the same) is also <kanji>seven</kanji>. So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of the kanji as well.	Make sure you know your radicals well and you'll be A-Okay on this one!	You know this kanji means <kanji>Seven</kanji>, so let's use that to remember the reading too. <kanji>Seven</kanji> is a lucky number, usually, but this time it wasn't so good.   <kanji>Seven</kanji> percent is all she got on her test after <reading>she chea</reading>ted (<ja>しち</ja>) on it.	"How unbelievable is it that someone got <kanji>seven</kanji> percent on a test, especially if you try to cheat? Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the ""she"" part in <reading>she chea</reading>ted (<ja>しち</ja>). Then, imagine your happiness when she's super upset about getting seven percent on it. Serves her right, obviously."		30	-	kanji Lesson_1
人	Kanji	人	Person	radical	Person	Person		<reading>にん</reading> <reading>じん</reading>	ひと と			にん, じん	ひと, と								Remember how the radical version of this kanji meant <radical>person</radical> because it's a person walking from the side with their arms down? Well this is a <kanji>person</kanji> too!	Know the radicals, and you shall know the kanji.	Only one <kanji>person</kanji> at <reading>Nintendo</reading> (<ja>にん</ja>) complained about the new <reading>jean</reading>s (<ja>じん</ja>) policy, and that person was you.	Imagine how angry you were about the policy. You'll have to come up with something to be angry about yourself (pick something that would actually make you angry, like maybe you're only allowed to wear cut off short-shorts jeans at Nintendo now), but if you pick something good, you'll definitely remember the two readings for this. Just remember you're working at <reading>Nintendo</reading>, and the policy has to be something about <reading>jean</reading>s. Then, imagine yourself as the only <kanji>person</kanji> complaining and everyone else in their dumb jeans (or lack-thereof) shaking their head at you because you're being a fool.		31	-	kanji Lesson_1
入	Kanji	入	Enter	radical	Enter	Enter		<reading>にゅう</reading>	はい い			にゅう	はい, い								The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>enter</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>enter</kanji> as well.	Make sure you know those radicals, yo!	Turns out, after you <kanji>enter</kanji> the teepee (you'll remember that the radical is a teepee with a big entrance to it), you're given a <reading>new</reading> (<ja>にゅう</ja>) one! Now you have two teepees!	Imagine lights turning on and flashing, and an entire audience inside. You're at a gameshow, and the announcer announces the <reading>neeeeew</reading> teepee in his announcey voice. Feel the surprise. Feel the happiness. Feel the excitement. A beautiful new teepee all for you! 		32	-	kanji Lesson_1
八	Kanji	ハ	Fins	radical	Eight	Eight, 8		<reading>はち</reading>	や よう			はち	や, よう								"This isn't exactly the same as the <radical>fins</radical> radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly ""modified radical"" version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? <kanji>Eight</kanji> fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each."	"Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think ""Wow, I have to smell all eight of these?"" Yes, you do."	After you count and smell all <kanji>eight</kanji> of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large <reading>hatch</reading> (<ja>はち</ja>) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.	You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?		33	-	kanji Lesson_1
力	Kanji	力	Power	radical	Power, Strength	Power, Strength		<reading>りょく</reading> <reading>りき</reading>	ちから			りょく, りき	ちから								The radical and the meaning of this kanji are the same. Both are <kanji>Power</kanji>.	If you know the radicals, you should be feeling fine... No, you should feel powerful!	Who has the most Power of anyone? It's the <kanji>Power</kanji> Rangers. Who are they battling? <reading>Ricky the Rock</reading> (<ja>りき</ja>, <ja>りょく</ja>) Monster.	Know anyone named <reading>Ricky</reading> (<ja>りき</ja>), even a famous person like Ricky Ricardo or Ricky Gervais? Put his face on the monster the <kanji>Power</kanji> Rangers are fighting. Also, imagine him throwing <reading>rocks</reading> (<ja>りょく</ja>) and hitting people with them. You should imagine it as more gruesome than Power Rangers was on the show. This is real, yo (and gruesome will help you to remember).		34	-	kanji Lesson_1
十	Kanji	十	Cross	radical	Ten	Ten, 10		<reading>じゅう</reading>	とお			じゅう	とお								This <radical>cross</radical> is the symbol for the number <kanji>ten</kanji>. A good way to remember this is to think about all the religions that have crosses and also important sets of tens. 	If you're familiar with Christianity, they have a cross and ten commandments. Cross = ten, you see?	This cross in particular has <kanji>ten</kanji> <reading>jew</reading>els (<ja>じゅう</ja>) on it. Two on each arm and two in the middle. That's ten jewels!	Picture the jewels on this cross. Maybe draw it out on a piece of paper so the visual really sticks. Each cross is really a symbol for different sets of ten things, and in this case, it's ten jewels.		35	-	kanji Lesson_1
三	Kanji	一, 二	Ground, Two	radical, radical	Three	Three, 3		<reading>さん</reading>	み			さん	み								"This kanji is made up of the ground radical (which also happens to be the kanji for ""one"") and the radical for two. Combine <radical>one</radical> and <radical>two</radical> together and what do you get? <kanji>Three</kanji>!"	This one should be pretty self explanatory! Even easier, you can look at this kanji and see it has three straight lines. You know what one looks like. You know what two looks like. So... this is three!	"<kanji>Three</kanji> is the number of chances you get with <reading>San</reading>ta-san (<ja>さん</ja>). He has a list, and when you get to three ""naughty things"" lines, that's it. You're on Santa-san's three strikes and you're out list."	Picture Santa-san sitting at his desk at the North Pole, eating cookies, and marking one, two, then finally three lines next to names. Once the third line appears, the kid doesn't get presents anymore.		36	-	kanji Lesson_1
上	Kanji	ト, 一	Toe, Ground	radical, radical	Above, Up, Over	Above, Up, Over		<reading>じょう</reading>	うえ あ のぼ うわ かみ			じょう	うえ, あ, のぼ, うわ, かみ								You find a <radical>toe</radical> on the <radical>ground</radical>. It's weird, because it's <kanji>above</kanji> the ground, not where toes belong.	Focus your imagination on how body parts should be buried, not above ground like this. Sure, finding a toe is a little strange, but finding a toe above the ground? Downright silly.	Of course when you find a toe <kanji>above</kanji> the ground, you want to know where the toe came from. When you examine it, you see a name written on there. This toe belongs to the local clumsy farmhand, <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>).	Try to remember Jourm, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is <ja>じょう</ja>.  He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) <ja>じょ</ja>. Although Jourm will develop as you go through all the <ja>じょう</ja> reading kanji, for now just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude who works for a local farmer. Also, he only has nine or fewer toes, apparently.		37	-	kanji Lesson_1
下	Kanji	一, ト	Ground, Toe	radical, radical	Below, Down, Under, Beneath	Below, Down, Under, Beneath		<reading>か</reading> <reading>げ</reading>	した さ くだ お			か, げ	した, さ, くだ, お								There's a <radical>toe</radical> <kanji>below</kanji> <radical>ground</radical>.	So, where is the <radical>toe</radical> now? It's <kanji>below</kanji> ground. Imagine yourself digging it out, and thinking... ugh, why does it have to be <kanji>below</kanji> ground like this? So irritating. Will I be able to sew it back on in time to save it?	You keep digging for the <radical>toe</radical> <kanji>below</kanji> the <radical>ground</radical>, and instead of hitting a <radical>toe</radical> you hit something hard and metallic. You keep digging and digging around it, but it's huge. Turns out, you found yourself a <reading>car</reading> (<ja>か</ja>). Keep digging until you unearth the car. Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.	There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is <ja>げ</ja>, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read <ja>下</ja> as <ja>げ</ja>. That's the problem with really common kanji - too many readings.		38	-	kanji Lesson_1
工	Kanji	工	Construction	radical	Construction, Industry	Construction, Industry		<reading>こう</reading> <reading>く</reading>				こう, く									The <radical>construction</radical> radical and the <kanji>construction</kanji> kanji are the same!  This kanji also means <kanji>industry</kanji>, which is what construction is, if you think about it. It's all part of the construction industry.	Know your radicals and you'll know this kanji's meaning.	For kanji that use the <ja>こう</ja> (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character <ja>こういち</ja> every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see <ja>こう</ja>, think <ja>こういち</ja>.  You see some <kanji>construction</kanji> in front of you. There, standing shirtless (only a suspender and hard hat) is (<ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>), looking back at you.	If <ja>こういち</ja> as a construction worker standing in a construction site some how doesn't make your legs tremble, that's okay and totally normal. Do make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants!?). Why is he using that bulldozer like that?  Alternatively, say you really do like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better looking version of <ja>こういち</ja>'s actual face, though). You and <ja>こういち</ja> make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a very deep conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it.  Hint: When you see <ja>工</ja> in a kanji it will often take the <ja>こう</ja> reading. Remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!		39	-	kanji Lesson_1
口	Kanji	口	Mouth	radical	Mouth	Mouth		<reading>こう</reading> <reading>く</reading>	くち			こう, く	くち								The <radical>mouth</radical> radical and the <kanji>mouth</kanji> kanji are exactly the same!	If you learned your radicals–which the WaniKani system forces you to do (unless you're cheating)–you'll already know the meaning of the kanji.	Do you remember seeing the construction worker <ja>こういち</ja> earlier in the <ja>工</ja> mnemonic? If you haven't yet, not to worry!  For kanji with <ja>こう</ja> readings (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character <ja>こういち</ja> every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see <ja>こう</ja>, think <ja>こういち</ja>.  Everyone agrees, (<reading><ja>こう</ja></reading><ja>いち</ja>)'s <kanji>mouth</kanji> is his best feature. You stare at it lovingly as he whispers sweet kanji readings to you.  	You just can't forget all the cool things about kanji learning he said from that mouth. What a great mouth <ja>こういち</ja> has. How are the lips of his mouth both so skinny and fat at the same time?		40	-	kanji Lesson_1
大	Kanji	大	Big	radical	Big, Large	Big, Large		<reading>たい</reading> <reading>だい</reading>	おお	ひろ		たい, だい	おお, ひろ								The <radical>big</radical> radical and the <kanji>big</kanji> kanji are exactly the same!	So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of this kanji as well.	There's this big guy (that's how you remember the radical, remember?), and he's wearing a huge <reading>Tie Dye</reading> (<ja>たい</ja>, <ja>だい</ja>) shirt. Because he's so huge, the tie dye shirt is also super huge. Everything about him is pretty big, but the tie dye stands out more than anything.	When you look at the big guy in your head, imagine him covered in tie dye head to toe. Think about how ridiculous it looks on him, especially since he's such a big guy. Shirt. Sweatpants. Hat. Shoes... it goes on and on.		41	-	kanji Lesson_1
女	Kanji	女	Woman	radical	Woman	Woman, Female		<reading>じょ</reading>	おんな め			じょ	おんな, め								The radical for <radical>woman</radical> and the kanji for <kanji>woman</kanji> are exactly the same.	That means if you know your radicals well, you know the meaning of this kanji as well! How swell.	"When you think of a <kanji>woman</kanji>, think of <reading>Jo</reading>-Anne (<ja>じょ</ja>), though she usually goes by just ""Jo."""	Whenever the reading <ja>じょ</ja> comes up, we will use the character Jo-Anne. She's quite a short woman, which is to help us differentiate <ja>じょ</ja> from <ja>じょう</ja> (who is the giant, oafish farmhand Jourm). <ja>じょ</ja> is a smaller lady, <ja>じょう</ja> is a giant man.		42	-	kanji Lesson_1
山	Kanji	山	Mountain	radical	Mountain	Mountain		<reading>さん</reading>	やま			さん	やま								The <radical>mountain</radical> radical and the <kanji>mountain</kanji> kanji are the same.	Make sure you're studying your radicals. If you are, then you're studying your kanji as well!	"Think about <kanji>mountains</kanji> talking to each other, calling each other by their names and adding the Japanese name-ender <reading>san</reading> (<ja>さん</ja>) to each of their names. ""Hello, Everest-<reading>san</reading>."" ""Oh hi, Fuji-<reading>san</reading>."""	Be sure to imagine this vividly. The more absurdly you can imagine it, the more likely you are to remember the reading, <reading>san</reading>.		43	-	kanji Lesson_1
川	Kanji	川	River	radical	River	River		せん	<reading>かわ</reading>			かわ	せん								The <radical>river</radical> radical and the <kanji>river</kanji> kanji are the same as each other!	So, if you know the radical you know the kanji as well.	You're standing next to a <kanji>river</kanji> that's actually used as a <reading>ca</reading>r <reading>wa</reading>sh (<ja>かわ</ja>). 	Imagine standing by the river, watching all those cars floating by. They start off really dirty, but the river washes them all clean.		44	-	kanji Lesson_1
一	Vocabulary	一	One	kanji	One	One, 1					<reading>いち</reading>	いち		Numeral	一ど、あいましょう。	Let’s meet up once.	一いはアメリカ人でした。	First place was an American.	ぼくはせかいで一ばんよわい。	I’m the weakest (person) in the world.	As is the case with most vocab words that consist of a single kanji, this vocab word has the same meaning as the kanji it parallels, which is <vocabulary>one</vocabulary>.		When a vocab word is all alone and has no okurigana (hiragana attached to kanji) connected to it, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, however.

This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.  This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means <kanji>above</kanji> so this means something rises. For example: A fever rises. The sun rises. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means <vocabulary>to rise</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to go up</vocabulary>.		"Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading, which also happens to be a reading you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. Let's use a mnemonic for the kun'yomi reading now, though. You have to remember at least the <ja>あ</ja> part to read it.  You know that this word means <vocabulary>to rise</vocabulary>. Imagine something just rising on its own, like a floating tree or something. What would you say? Probably a ""surprised"" sound. Maybe you'd scream ""<ja><reading>あ</reading></ja>!"" when you saw this floating tree.  If you need help remembering the hiragana part, imagine that it's a girl rising up and you scream ""<reading>Ah! Girl!</reading>""(<ja>あがる</ja>)."

"This vocab word is an exception in almost every way. It has a similar meaning to the meaning of the kanji, and you know it's a verb because it ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound (<ja>る</ja>, in this case). But, the meaning is <vocabulary>to climb</vocabulary>. Comparing it to the other <ja>上</ja> verb words, it has the least okurigana (versus <ja>上げる</ja> and <ja>上がる</ja>). You could remember this and know that the thing you don't want to do the most is ""to climb,"" so that's why it has the least okurigana."		"The reading for this word is an exception from all the rules of the <ja>上</ja> vocabulary. It consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, so it will use the kun'yomi reading.

If you're not a boy, think about how weird it is that he called you a boy. If you are a grown man, think how you wish he called you ""dude"" or something, not ""boy.""

Squirrels come down from trees. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means <vocabulary>to get lower</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to fall</vocabulary>.		Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.
