You don't see omens that often, so of course you're going to stare. We'll imagine what the omen is in the reading mnemonic.

There is a lot of this <kanji>bacteria</kanji> in the <reading>Kin</reading>g (<ja>きん</ja>) of England's mouth.

They were super wet before, but you figure the sun probably dried them off. You lean down to touch them and nope, they's still <kanji>damp</kanji>.	The sun did a little bit of work, so they aren't wet, but they aren't dry either. They're damp.	As you're looking at the <kanji>damp</kanji> spikes, a <reading>shih tzu</reading> (<ja>しつ</ja>) prances over, slips on the damp ground, and falls right on the spike! Oh nooo!	Luckily the shih tzu is kinda pinned between the spikes, so it isn't dead or anything, but it's definitely stuck. You try to help it out, but you slip because it's so damp and you fall in too!

If you earn a lot of money, you have more grains.	Imagine looking at the grains in the houses of people who make vastly different earnings. The poor artist has only a few sacks of grain. The rich samurai has an extra house just for holding his grain. That's how you know he has much higher earnings than the artist.	Another way to check someone's <kanji>earnings</kanji> is to see if they have a <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>). Would someone who doesn't make a lot of money have a car? No!

She's in your house because you married her. Thus, she's your bride. Your house is now a home.	Now that you have a <kanji>bride</kanji> in your house, you can get rid of <reading>yo</reading>ur <reading>mai</reading>d (<ja>よめ</ja>), since your bride will do all the cleaning.	Your bride is very upset at how sexist you're being right now, and makes you do all the cleaning instead. The maid still gets fired.		6867	-	kanji Lesson_45

In the <kanji>gutter</kanji> is a lifeguard, so Emperor <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja> decides to survey the damage.	"""This lifeguard didn't believe in the power of kanji learning,"" <ja>こういち</ja> says to the press. ""He was punished by the great Crabigator, who sent its tsunami as a warning for all.""

This skinny tsunami of water flying down to the ground is a <kanji>waterfall</kanji>.	Can you see why a tsunami dragon (especially the Asian skinny snake-like kind) could be a waterfall? Try to imagine it.	Despite how cool a dragon <kanji>waterfall</kanji> is, to be honest it's also pretty <reading>tacky</reading> (<ja>たき</ja>).	Now imagine it being a bit tacky.

"You might see that <kanji>crazy</kanji> <kanji>lunatic</kanji> hanging around the outskirts of <ja><reading>きょう</reading>と</ja>.
