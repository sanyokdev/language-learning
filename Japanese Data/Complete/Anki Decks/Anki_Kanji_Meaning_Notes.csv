But, it's odd. It's perfectly <radical>pi</radical> shaped (that is, circular). Some kind of piceratops, if you will. The reason they are this shape is because they want to absorb as much <kanji>sunlight</kanji> (or just <kanji>light</kanji> is fine, too) as possible. They evolved to be round so they don't have any corners casting a shadow.<br><br>

Think of each ""time"" a thing happens, it loops back around and comes back to the beginning, revolving around again another time.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine yourself counting and counting smaller and smaller mouths inside of each other, recording the number of times you can find a mouth inside another mouth.

- Hint: You'll have to think of the ""sea"" as its own entity, controlling the tsunami, otherwise you might confuse and combine the two. So when you point your gun out the window, aim it at the ""sea,"" not the ""tsunami."" It's like aiming for the head of a zombie and not the arms or legs."	Kanji Meaning	-	Kanji_Meaning Level_6

Where did it come from? ""Ah, it came from <kanji>yonder</kanji>,"" you say, <kanji>facing</kanji> that way.<br><br>

- Hint: Yonder is a bit of a weird word, but it fits the meaning of this kanji quite well. You'll have to trust me that it's more useful in Japanese than it is in English. When you imagine through this mnemonic, make sure the drop comes from the side and hits you in the mustache with quite a bit of force. That means it came from a far distance thus making you look over ""yonder."""	Kanji Meaning	-	Kanji_Meaning Level_6

So, to make the leader tall enough, you <kanji>attach</kanji> another head to the top of the leader's head.<br><br>

- Hint: Make sure you really feel like the person can’t be a leader because they’re too short when you measure them (I know this isn’t true, but we’re remembering kanji here, anything goes!). As long as you feel disconcerted that the leader isn’t tall enough, you should be able to remember that you need to attach something to the leader to make them tall enough. The fact that you’re attaching another head to the top of the leader's head is pretty weird too, and should help you to remember the meaning."	Kanji Meaning	-	Kanji_Meaning Level_7

- Hint: The sick part of this is that those dollar <kanji>bills</kanji> were once this tree's friends. The tree is sobbing uncontrollably as pieces of his friends fall on him and all around him - which is why he's using the umbrella to protect himself."	Kanji Meaning	-	Kanji_Meaning Level_7

That is not a ceremony. A ceremony has a past. A ceremony is done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a <kanji>ritual</kanji> first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish ceremony.<br><br>

This kanji also means <kanji>equation</kanji> for some reason too. Just think of a ceremony that involves doing math and coming up with equations. How strange would that be? Pretend you're at this ceremony.<br><br>
