You keep going and start singing along. Boo boo boop. Boo do do do doop! Finger beats!	Imagine yourself in a completely white room. All you have is the white walls, your fingers, and your beats. When you stop all you're left with is white noise. Yuck! Keep those beats coming!	This <kanji>beat</kanji> is sick, but as you tap you realize you're <reading>hack</reading>ing (<ja>はく</ja>) up the wall! Slowly but surely, your fingers are hacking out little bits of the wall. And the beats don't sound as good until you move to a new, clean white area.	Imagine hacking the wall apart as you try to keep this beat going. The music is all you have, man! You can't lose the beat now!		8316	-	kanji Lesson_56

You keep checking outside to see if they have stopped, but they are still drinking. They haven't stopped yet.	The animal with horns that is <kanji>still</kanji> drinking your alcohol is no animal at all. It is actually one of the local <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>) dressed up like a horned animal so they can drink as long as they want and you'll be too scared to shoo them away.	You keep checking, but that youth is still drinking. Of course, you don't know they are a youth, so it's quite impressive an animal can drink this much.		8317	-	kanji Lesson_56
宰	Kanji	宀, 辛	Roof, Spicy	radical, radical	Manager	Manager		<reading>さい</reading>				さい									Your <radical>roof</radical> is <radical>spicy</radical> because you're the <kanji>manager</kanji>. You're always testing new recipes in your house to share with everyone who works under you, but that makes all the spice stick to your roof (since it doesn't have good ventilation like a restaurant or a lab would).	Picture yourself as the manager of a restaurant or a science lab. You have to test all of your managerial methods at home before you can bring them to work. And if you were to lick that roof of yours... it would be spicy from all of your experiments.	You've finally done it. You're now the <kanji>manager</kanji> of a bunch of spicy new <reading>cy</reading>borgs (<ja>さい</ja>). You've been toiling away for over a year, but you've finally replaced the cyborg you lost, and now you can manage them properly without anyone getting in the way. 	Unfortunately, you couldn't figure out how to make non-spicy cyborgs, but that's okay because you're going to be the best cyborg manager ever! No one will ever take them away from you again.		8318	-	kanji Lesson_56

Anyone who sits in that stool will be <kanji>lonely</kanji>.	Imagine sitting on this small stool, waaaaay up there above the roof. You can't see anyone and you can't talk to anyone. You feel this awful emptiness inside. That's what it's like to be lonely.	You're so <kanji>lonely</kanji>, you make up an imaginary friend: <reading>Jack</reading> (<ja>じゃく</ja>). Jack doesn't get rid of the lonely feeling because he isn't real, but he is a distraction at least.	"You're so busy talking to Jack, you don't hear the voices from below, ""Aren't you lonely up there, miss? Do you want us to get a jack to get you down? Hello?

You don't have a lock, so sewing your scooter up to the signpost to keep it safe is all you can think of.	Imagine slowly sewing your scooter to the signpost, passing the thread back and forth through the signpost's metal holes and your scooter's handles.	You usually only <kanji>sew</kanji> at <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>), so this is a big exception for you. You're usually worried that if you sew in public people will judge your stitches, so this is a big step for you!

This makes it a pretty <kanji>mediocre</kanji> table. The water drops haven't really damaged it that much, it still stands and you can use it, but it's kinda ugly, so it's just mediocre.	You didn't expect to see water drop damage on this table so now your mood is mediocre too.	"You weren't expecting to see such a <kanji>mediocre</kanji> table so you go up to the guy who's selling it and say, ""Hey, I have a <reading>bone</reading> (<ja>ぼん</ja>) to pick with you!"" But he doesn't think there is a bone to pick at all, he doesn't think the table is mediocre like you do."	Imagine having a bone to pick with someone because they're trying to sell you something mediocre and they just won't listen. Now you have a bone to pick with the person who recommended this guy to you!		8322	-	kanji Lesson_56

If you end up working with someone long enough, and they end up being really great, you'll respect them too! 	Imagine being a small drop of water and seeing other drops of water come to help you by working together. You'd really respect them, right?	"If you <kanji>respect</kanji> someone enough you'll even take up their hobbies. The person you respect most loves the Yankees. You don't really feel the same, but you respect that about them so you chant, ""<reading>Ooh Ya</reading>nkees, <reading>Ooh Ya</reading>nkees <ja>うやうや</ja> with them during each game."

It's <kanji>mixed</kanji> with something else.	You could swear this thing was gold a long time ago. Now it's a mix of different things.	It's <kanji>mixed</kanji> (and not pure anymore) because it was put in that <reading>sack</reading> (<ja>さく</ja>) filled with various other things.	Since it was in that sack for so long, it just ended up getting mixed with the other stuff in that sack. It was gold a long time ago, but now it's mixed with everything else.		8324	-	kanji Lesson_56
穀	Kanji	士, 冖, 禾, 殳	Samurai, Forehead, Grain, Weapon	radical, radical, radical, radical	Grain	Grain		<reading>こく</reading>				こく									A <radical>samurai</radical> hits the <radical>forehead</radical>s of <radical>grain</radical>s with his <radical>weapon</radical> so the <kanji>grain</kanji>s will pop off and into his mouth. He doesn't want to kill the plants, so he's just skimming the grain's foreheads so they'll fall off and he can eat them.	Picture the samurai taking out his weapon and spinning in a lightning fast circle. The forehead grains pop off and come raining into his open mouth.	Phew, all of this <kanji>grain</kanji> is making the samurai thirsty, so he reaches in his bag and pulls out an ice cold, refreshing <reading>Coke</reading> (<ja>こく</ja>).	These grains aren't even cooked, they're just hard and raw, so the Coke really helps wash them down.		8325	-	kanji Lesson_56

Mausoleums and <kanji>tomb</kanji>s weren't made for living people, so they aren't insulated from the cold. No one cares if a dead body gets frostbite.	Unfortunately, you're realizing this because you thought a mausoleum would be a good hiding place from the winter cold. Spoilers, it's not.	You need to escape this <kanji>mausoleum</kanji> now but the only way out is on a <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat over a creepy frozen pond. You've heard of these mausoleum row boats before, and you're pretty sure they're cursed.	Imagine taking your frostbitten fingers and trying to get away from the mausoleum in this row boat. It looks like it was made of bones and it is not very seaworthy. But you row with all your might, because you don't want to end up a permanent fixture in this tomb!		8326	-	kanji Lesson_56

Penguins are seen in groups a lot, sure, but did you know that any time there are exactly twenty penguins in a group they're plotting evil things? Evil things like global warming. And how to eat all the fish in the world so humans can't have any.	"Imagine walking around in the arctic when you stumble upon an evil group of penguins. They'd be cute if they weren't holding papers with ""Kill All Humans"" on them and tiny guns in their penguin hands."	The <kanji>evil</kanji> penguins can't let you tell the other human's what you've seen, so they murder you and hide your body in a <reading>hay</reading>stack (<ja>へい</ja>). Your family will never know what happened to you. The penguins will get away with their evil plans.	Only someone or, in this case, something truly evil would kill someone and hide their remains under some hay. That's really disrespectful and, well, evil.		8327	-	kanji Lesson_56

Boats don't need to be a bright white color. But, ships do! They're dangerous and big, so they paint them nice and white.	A white-painted <kanji>ship</kanji> is a kind of <reading>hack</reading> (<ja>はく</ja>). It makes the ship more visible without costing much.	"You can also imagine hacking the ship's computer.

It's really important to remember how many things are under your control when you operate a vehicle. It isn't just the people in your car either, it's everyone and everything in your way too.	You have to maintain <kanji>control</kanji> of your car or you'll hit a bunch of <reading>cats</reading> (<ja>かつ</ja>). The roads are full of cats at all times.

As the mole <kanji>suffocate</kanji>s it <reading>cheats</reading> (<ja>ちつ</ja>) and shoves its head into your closed hand. You realize what it's doing and squeeze your hand tighter so it's more like a hole. You can feel the mole breathing again now.
