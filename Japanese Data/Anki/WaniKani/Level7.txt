卩	Radical				Stamp	Stamp															This radical looks a little like the letter P, right? It's a P printed onto something... wait, it's not printed, it's a <radical>stamp</radical> that's been put on the paper. Peter Parker likes to use stamps instead of pens.					922	-	Lesson_7 radical
夫	Radical				Husband	Husband															The radicals ground and big make up this radical. There's a big guy on the ground... who is that big guy? Embarrassingly, it's your <radical>husband</radical>. Feel the shame that he got knocked down on the ground. By what? Who? How? (It doesn't matter.)					923	-	Lesson_7 radical
氏	Radical				Clan	Clan, Duck															This looks like a little tamagotchi or (if you aren't a 90s kid) a duck. What do both of these critters have in common? They have really crazy <radical>clan</radical> followings. And the people who enjoy them (tiny pocket games or watching quacking duckies) create clans that get together and share their experiences. Which clan are you a part of?					924	-	Lesson_7 radical
矛	Radical				Spear	Spear, Soldier															Your mama has been impaled on something! You run toward her and see that she's been impaled on a <radical>spear</radical>. Mama, no!					925	-	Lesson_7 radical
舟	Radical				Boat	Boat, Sail															This looks like a <radical>boat</radical> coming toward you in the water. See the billowing sail and the reflection off the water? That's what boats look like.					926	-	Lesson_7 radical
魚	Radical				Fish	Fish															In a prison on a rice paddy they're boiling something. What do you think it is? <radical>Fish!</radical>. What goes better with rice? What's easy to find, making it cheap prison food? Fish, of course!					927	-	Lesson_7 radical
鳥	Radical				Bird	Bird															See the cool wing on the bottom? See the head with the neat feather coming out of the top? This is a <radical>bird</radical>. Tweet tweet!					928	-	Lesson_7 radical
黄	Radical				Yellow	Yellow															Flowers that grow out of the ground of a rice paddy after you bury fins there will grow <radical>yellow</radical>. Why? Because yellow is the color of a fish's soul, so planting flowers over their fins will turn them into a nice, pretty yellow. 					929	-	Lesson_7 radical
黒	Radical				Black	Black															If you boil a village everything will turn <radical>black</radical>. Mostly because you're a crazed murderer, but more so because when you boil a village all the roads melt and coat everything in black tar. Picture it! It looks like Pompeii. (Oof, too soon?)					930	-	Lesson_7 radical
周	Radical				Circumference	Circumference, Ghost															Put some dirt around your head and in your mouth to figure out your head's <radical>circumference</radical>. When you pull your head out you'll have the perfect shape of your head, making measuring the circumference easy. Oh, and the dirt in your mouth? That's just for the taste.					931	-	Lesson_7 radical
勿	Radical				Wing	Wing															See the <radical>wing</radical>? It's kind of like a bat wing with webbing. Either way, it's just a wing.					932	-	Lesson_7 radical
几	Radical				Table	Table															What happens when you put a flat surface on top of a pair of legs? You get a <radical>table</radical>.					933	-	Lesson_7 radical
寺	Radical				Temple	Temple															This radical looks kind of like a <radical>temple</radical> on a hill, don't you think? With all the layers, n' stuff? Just picture that first horizontal line as the base of the ornate temple balancing on that hill underneath it and you'll have no problem remembering this radical.					934	-	Lesson_7 radical
門	Radical				Gate	Gate															This radical already looks like a <radical>gate</radical>, right? Just imagine a big gate with two pillars, one on either side. Then, up above are the doors, which can come down at any moment.					935	-	Lesson_7 radical
己	Radical				Oneself	Oneself, Cobra															This looks a bit like a backwards S. S for Self. But it's backwards because you didn't want to mix yourself up with any of the other selves out there, so you flipped it. That's why it means <radical>oneself</radical>. (That's you!)  This radical will appear as things like yourself, herself, etc., so keep that in mind!					936	-	Lesson_7 radical
豕	Radical				Pig	Pig															You have the animal radical in this already, that should be a clue. What kind of animal is it? It's in the ground, covered in mud. Also, there are toes laying around with it, because this animal will eat anything (good way to get rid of bodies... I hear). So what's this animal that's covered in mud and eats toes because it will eat anything? It's a <radical>pig</radical>!					937	-	Lesson_7 radical
孝	Radical				Teacher	Teacher															This radical is made up of coffin and child. To keep a child out of a coffin they'll need a good <radical>teacher</radical> to make sure they know not to stick forks in outlets or dance in traffic. That's why this radical is a teacher.					938	-	Lesson_7 radical
且	Radical				Top Hat	Top Hat															This radical looks just like a top hat. That's why it's <radical>top hat</radical>!					939	-	Lesson_7 radical
欠	Kanji	欠	Lack	radical	Lack	Lack		<reading>けつ</reading>	か			けつ	か								This kanji is the same as the radical it comes from. <radical>Lack</radical> becomes <kanji>Lack</kanji>!	If you know the radical you know this.	"To remember <ja>けつ</ja>, we use the word ""ketsup."" It's the perfect blend of ketchup and catsup!  You're <kanji>lack</kanji>ing something in your fridge. You look around, trying to find the <reading>ketsu</reading>p (<ja>けつ</ja>) you lack. You can't find it, because you lack it."	Imagine having to use regular, ordinary ketchup, or just old, boring catsup on your burger. Or even worse, an actual tomato. BLEH!		940	-	kanji Lesson_7
氏	Kanji	氏	Clan	radical	Family Name, Last Name, Surname	Family Name, Last Name, Surname		<reading>し</reading>	うじ			し	うじ								"Your <radical>clan</radical> is where you get your name. But not your given name, your <kanji>family name</kanji>. That's why people have names that mean ""in a rice paddy"" and ""near the ferry crossing."" The location of your clan determined your <kanji>surname</kanji>! Hope your ancestors didn't live on ""Poo Lake"" or something."	Think about your own surname in your language. Where did it come from? Were you a clan of village dwellers? Maybe you made shoes! You should look it up and find out!	Don't worry, I'll tell you where your <kanji>family name</kanji> came from. Your family used to herd <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>). You read that right, your family was of the sheep clan because you took care of sheep all day.	"Imagine your ancestors, herding sheep. Thanks to them your name means ""sheep people."" Thanks great great great great great grand pappy."		941	-	kanji Lesson_7
由	Kanji	十, 口	Cross, Mouth	radical, radical	Reason	Reason		<reading>ゆう</reading>	よし よ			ゆう	よし, よ								"A giant <radical>cross</radical> with a <radical>mouth</radical> stands above you. ""I am <kanji>reason</kanji>!"" it says to you. It is the Cross of Reason."	Because it's a cross with a mouth, it thinks that it is reason in all the chaos.	The <kanji>reason</kanji> that this Cross of Reason exists is to combat the <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>) of the world, who just bring chaos into everything.	"""Those youths just do things for no reason! That's why I, the Cross of Reason is here! I will knock some reason into those youths."""		942	-	kanji Lesson_7
札	Kanji	木, 乚	Tree, Umbrella	radical, radical	Bill, Tag, Label, Note	Bill, Tag, Label, Note		<reading>さつ</reading>	ふだ			さつ	ふだ								The <radical>tree</radical> has an <radical>umbrella</radical>, and it's holding it over his head, which is strange, because trees normally like water... turns out, it's not water falling on him, but dollar <kanji>bills</kanji> floating down.	The sick part of this is that those dollar <kanji>bills</kanji> were once this tree's friends. The tree is sobbing uncontrollably as pieces of his friends fall on him and all around him - which is why he's using the umbrella to protect himself.	The tree couldn’t take the body parts of his friends falling down on him, so he <reading>sat</reading> (<ja>さつ</ja>) down, and began crying uncontrollably.	What else could he do? He couldn’t move, so he sat. It’s weird imagining a tree trying to sit…		943	-	kanji Lesson_7
民	Kanji	口, 氏	Mouth, Clan	radical, radical	Peoples, People, Nation	Peoples, People, Nation		<reading>みん</reading>	たみ			みん	たみ								The <radical>mouth</radical> <radical>clan</radical> are a group of <kanji>people</kanji>. They are the <kanji>people</kanji> of a <kanji>nation</kanji>.	The mouth clan are distinct peoples. They do, of course, use their mouths.	The mouth clan <kanji>peoples</kanji> are a <kanji>nation</kanji> of <kanji>people</kanji> who use their mouths to say <reading>mean</reading> (<ja>みん</ja>) things to other peoples.	That's why they're the mouth clan. This nation of people are known for mouthing off and saying mean things. Imagine them, as a nation, saying mean things to you. How awful! All being from the same place, they're all into it too. In a way, they're not the mouth clan, they're the mean clan.		944	-	kanji Lesson_7
辺	Kanji	⻌, 刀	Scooter, Sword	radical, radical	Area	Area		<reading>へん</reading>	あた べ			へん	あた, べ								While riding your <radical>scooter</radical>, you take your <radical>sword</radical> and cut out an <kanji>area</kanji> on the ground. This whole place is your area now!	Imagine riding your scooter around in a really large circle, pressing your sword into the ground as you do. Once you close the circle, you claim to everyone around that this is YOUR area, and they aren't allowed in.	"As you look down at your <kanji>area</kanji>, you suddenly realize there is a <reading>hen</reading> (<ja>へん</ja>) pecking at the ground in there. ""Um, excuse me, hen, I believe I said this is MY area?!"" You try to kick it out, but it hops over your leg."	Imagine doing everything you can to get this hen out of your area, but it manages to dodge and outwit you at every turn. You even slash at it with your sword and try to run it over with your scooter, but the hen can't be stopped. This is the hen's area now. You have been defeated.		945	-	kanji Lesson_7
付	Kanji	ｲ, 寸	Leader, Measurement	radical, radical	Attach	Attach		ふ	<reading>つ</reading>			つ	ふ								You have the measurement of a leader. Imagine yourself measuring said leader (his/her height) and then coming up short. This is not good, you think. Leaders need to be at least six feet tall. So, to make the leader tall enough, you <kanji>attach</kanji> another head to the top of his/her head.	Make sure you really feel like the person can’t be a leader because they’re too short when you measure them (I know this isn’t true, but we’re remembering kanji here, anything goes!). As long as you feel disconcerted that the leader isn’t tall enough, you should be able to remember that you need to attach something to the leader to make him/her tall enough. The fact that you’re attaching another head to the top of his/her head is pretty weird too, and should help you to remember the meaning.	You have to remember the kun'yomi reading of this kanji, and the part you need to remember is <ja>つ</ja>. So, think of <kanji>attach</kanji>ing something to something else. What would you need? You'd need <reading>two</reading> (<ja>つ</ja>) things to put together!	Just focus on how attaching requires two things to remember this reading.		946	-	kanji Lesson_7
以	Kanji	L, 丶, 人	Lion, Drop, Person	radical, radical, radical	From, Since, Compared With, With, By Means Of	From, Since, Compared With, With, By Means Of		<reading>い</reading>				い									The <radical>lion</radical> drops a <radical>drop</radical> of saliva onto this <radical>person</radical> <kanji>from</kanji> above. The person is in a much worse place <kanji>compared with</kanji> where they were before, <kanji>since</kanji> they only just recently fell into this pit.	"Picture the person, the lion is leaning over them, the drop of spit dangling from their mouth. ""I-I want to go back where I came from,"" the person gasps, shaking."	<kanji>From</kanji> above there is a loud caw, and a giant <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) swoops down, forcing the lion to back off. The eagle grabs the person with its talons, bringing him into the air! But now he's... in the air being carried by a giant eagle, <kanji>compared with</kanji> where he was before, is this really better?!	The eagle came from the sky and technically rescued him, but compared to where he was before, it may not be a better situation. I think this person is going to be eaten either way.		947	-	kanji Lesson_7
失	Kanji	丿, 夫	Slide, Husband	radical, radical	Fault	Fault		<reading>しつ</reading>	うしな			しつ	うしな								That <radical>slide</radical> is your <radical>husband</radical>'s only <kanji>fault</kanji>. He loves that slide, more than you, and it's the only thing you don't like about him.	Imagine looking out the window of your house and watching your husband slide down his slide over and over. He's not even good at it, he falls off the side halfway down most of the time. You want to complain, but he's pretty decent otherwise. This is his only fault.	You try to come up with another <kanji>fault</kanji> of his so you can complain when you see a tiny <reading>shih tzu</reading> (<ja>しつ</ja>) trotting by. Oh no! Before you can call out, your husband has fallen off the slide and crushed the poor thing. You hear a sharp yelp and then nothing.	"You run outside and yell, ""AHA! It's your fault that shih tzu died! You and that stupid slide!"""		948	-	kanji Lesson_7

The patient is alive now... but they are definitely slated for <kanji>certain</kanji> death.	"As you imagine the mad scientist drawing blood out of the patient's heart with a small slide, also imagine a little meter hooked up to him as well. On one end is ""SURVIVE!"" on the other end is ""CERTAIN DEATH."" Right now the finger is pointing close to <kanji>certain</kanji> death, though :("	As the beeping heart thing starts to do one long continuous beeeeeeeeeeeeeep, the doctor puts his hands together and <reading>hits</reading> (<ja>ひつ</ja>) the dead patient over and over, attempting to bring him back.	Maybe imagine yourself running in there too, just trying to <reading>hit</reading> the patient back to life, because the patient was your friend.		949	-	kanji Lesson_7

Even though it's one of the fastest things on earth, your child is sitting in the back asking, ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" You have to keep responding. ""<kanji>Not yet</kanji>! Not yet! NOT YET!"""	Feel the irritation of this. How irritating is this kid going to be the whole flight over? The jet is going as fast as it can!	"What a selfish kid, right? Well, all he thinks about is ""<reading>Me</reading> (<ja>み</ja>) me me me me me me me me me me."" Hate kids like that."	"Go ahead and pretend to listen to the kid asking if we're there yet. Then in your mind go ""me me me me me me me"" quietly."		950	-	kanji Lesson_7
末	Kanji	未	Jet	radical	End	End		<reading>まつ</reading>	すえ			まつ	すえ								This kanji uses a modified <radical>jet</radical> radical. The front area of the wing is wider than the middle area of the wing. This may seem counterintuitive, but by doing this they can fit so much more jet fuel. The jet zooms off and keeps going for a long, long time, until it reaches the <kanji>end</kanji> of the earth.	Imagine the end of the earth being like how they imagined it pre-Columbus era. Just a big drop going off into space, giant waterfalls plummeting down. Your crazy jet has made it to the very end! Congratulations!	When you get to the <kanji>end</kanji> of the world, you land your jet and put out a few <reading>mats</reading> (<ja>まつ</ja>) to sit on so you can view the sights.

Every other leaf, however, will do the opposite, which is to grow in the <kanji>summer</kanji>.	Just think of the eye leaf as weird (it is weird, after all). It grows in the winter. Now, think of any normal leaves. They do the exact opposite, which is to grow in the summer.	Now it's summertime! What do you do during the <kanji>summer</kanji>? You just sit around with your favorite string tying <reading>knots</reading> (<ja>なつ</ja>) in it over and over again.	Think about summer. Now think about yourself tying knots.

Never fear! Look on up at the sun. Ah, yes. Blinding noon.	<kanji>Time</kanji> in a temple makes you think of <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>).
