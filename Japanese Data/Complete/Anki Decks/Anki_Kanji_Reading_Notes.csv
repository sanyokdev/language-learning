- Hint: Try to remember Jourm, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is <jp>じょう</jp>.<br><br>

- Hint: He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) <jp>じょ</jp>. Although Jourm will develop as you go through all the <jp>じょう</jp> reading kanji, for now just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude who works for a local farmer.

- Hint: The tacos pelt you and knock you off your feet. Hard shell, soft shell, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese... it's terrible.

- Hint: Imagine a world where each rain drop had to choose a target to aim for. How strange would rainfall be?

- Hint: In your mind, bulldoze the rice into the bay, watching it fill it up, then pile high. It's not particularly good looking land, but it'll do, and it's already full of seeds, so that's pretty good. The important thing is that you think you have way too much of the stuff, so the only way to get rid of it is to dump it in a large body of water, and that large body of water is a bay."
