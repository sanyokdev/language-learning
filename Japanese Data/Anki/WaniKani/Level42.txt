克	Kanji	古, 儿	Old, Legs	radical, radical	Overcome	Overcome		<reading>こく</reading>				こく									Even though you’ve <radical>old</radical> <radical>legs</radical>, you <kanji>overcome</kanji> your disability. These old legs of yours don’t work very well, but you overcome the odds and you run a marathon!	Imagine running a marathon with your old legs to prove you can overcome anything. Feel your old legs cramping up as you try to overcome the marathon and finish the race.	When you pass the finish line and finally <kanji>overcome</kanji> the limits of your old legs, someone hands you an ice cold <reading>Coke</reading> (<ja>こく</ja>) as a reward. Mmm, such a refreshing Coke.	Filled with the jubilation of achievement from overcoming all odds, imagine the flavor of this cold Coke in your mouth. Fizzy and Coke flavored, it runs down your throat and into your tummy. Yum.		6409	-	kanji Lesson_42
到	Kanji	至, 刂	Mole, Knife	radical, radical	Arrival	Arrival		<reading>とう</reading>				とう									"The <radical>mole</radical> has a <radical>knife</radical> ready for your <kanji>arrival</kanji>. You get out of your airplane, you step on the ground and... ouch! You stepped right on the knife, and there's the mole, sticking it out of the ground. ""I checked the schedule for your arrival!"" it squeaks happily, and disappears."	Welp, your arrival didn't go smoothly. You have a knife in your foot. I'm not sure what you did to make that mole hate you, but you'll have to be more careful next time.	Your <kanji>arrival</kanji> to <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja> is now ruined. And your next stop is now going to be an arrival at a <ja>とうきょう</ja> hospital to get this mole knife out.	This certainly wasn't the type of arrival you were expecting when you bought your tickets to <ja>とうきょう</ja>.		6410	-	kanji Lesson_42
双	Kanji	又	Stool	radical	Pair	Pair		<reading>そう</reading>	ふた			そう	ふた								If you have one <radical>stool</radical> and another <radical>stool</radical>, you have a <kanji>pair</kanji> of stools. Look at this pair of stools. Look at it.	Imagine being in front of this pair of stools. Picture yourself sitting on one stool, getting up, then sitting on the other. Repeat this process.	This <kanji>pair</kanji> of stools shares a <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Even if you tried to separate them, they'd eventually find their way back together.	It's the same with pairs of socks and pairs of people. Sometimes what looks like two things is really a perfect pair, with one soul. Meant to be together forever.		6411	-	kanji Lesson_42
哲	Kanji	扌, 斤, 口	Fingers, Axe, Mouth	radical, radical, radical	Philosophy	Philosophy		<reading>てつ</reading>				てつ									Put an <radical>axe</radical> in your <radical>mouth</radical> with your <radical>fingers</radical> to express your <kanji>philosophy</kanji>. Your philosophy of putting weapons in your mouth. Everyone else seems to think it's a stupid philosophy, so you're showing them that it's not with actions!	Imagine expressing your philosophy, your deepest thoughts and beliefs, by putting it in your mouth.	Your <kanji>philosophy</kanji> on weapons in mouths means you're always tasting <ja><reading>鉄</reading></ja> (<ja>てつ</ja>). They say blood tastes like copper, well weapons taste like iron.	Your philosophy and your way of life means everything tastes like <ja>鉄</ja> now, and you think everyone should be that way.		6412	-	kanji Lesson_42
喪	Kanji	十, 口, 衣	Cross, Mouth, Clothes	radical, radical, radical	Mourning	Mourning		<reading>そう</reading>	も			そう	も								Under the <radical>cross</radical> is a <radical>mouth</radical> and another <radical>mouth</radical> wearing special <radical>clothes</radical> because they're in <kanji>mourning</kanji>.	Picture the cross looming overhead, people's mouths open so they can sob loudly, and everyone wearing the same color clothes (just picture whatever color works for your particular culture/religion combo).	As the <kanji>mourning</kanji> continues, the <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>) of the dead person rises out of the cross. The soul looks around at all of the mourners and nods. Yes, your mourning has pleased it.	"If you aren't mourning enough, when the soul comes out of the person's body, it will get really mad. ""What, I'm not worth a few tears? Really?""

堅	Kanji	臣, 又, 土	Servant, Stool, Dirt	radical, radical, radical	Solid	Solid		けん	<reading>かた</reading>			かた	けん								A <radical>servant</radical> secures a <radical>stool</radical> in the <radical>dirt</radical> so that it is a <kanji>solid</kanji> sitting device. If you just throw a stool on the ground it will flop over easily. But if you have a servant to dig it into the dirt a bit, it becomes nice and solid and safe for sitting!	Picture two stools in your mind. One is solid, you want to sit on it. The other looks like the wind will knock it over. Don't sit on that!	You need this stool to be extra <kanji>solid</kanji> because you're using it to test your new <reading>cata</reading>pult (<ja>かた</ja>). If it isn't solid, when you launch it and yourself in the catapult, the stool might fall over, killing you both. And you don't want that, now do you?	You better hope that catapult is solid too. If it isn't the whole thing will come apart when you try to launch yourself into the air.		6414	-	kanji Lesson_42

It also becomes your <kanji>bed</kanji>, because hey, what is a floor but the original bed?	You lay it down, cut it into slats, and voila! A floor! And a bed!	News of your amazing <kanji>floor</kanji> / <kanji>bed</kanji> spreads and reaches the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>), who wants to come see it. He's impressed, and asks you to build floor beds out of trees laying under this canopy in all of his buildings.	This new floor + bed invention, along with your other accomplishments, have you being watched really closely by the Shougun now. He seems to be keeping an eye on you so he can swoop down and check out everything you do.		6415	-	kanji Lesson_42
括	Kanji	扌, 舌	Fingers, Tongue	radical, radical	Fasten	Fasten		<reading>かつ</reading>	くく			かつ	くく								Someone's <radical>fingers</radical> touch your <radical>tongue</radical> and <kanji>fasten</kanji> it together. You can't talk. All you can do is make sad tongue-less sounds as you try to figure out who would fasten your tongue like this.	Try to fasten your own tongue with your fingers right now. You probably can't do it, right? That's because your fingers are too big and your tongue is too slippery.	"Only one creature could use its fingers to <kanji>fasten</kanji> your tongue like this: <reading>cats</reading> (<ja>かつ</ja>). Cats are notorious for fastening tongues so that people can't speak. Haven't you ever heard the phrase, ""Cat got your tongue?"""	In this case, many cats fastened your tongue.

弧	Kanji	弓, 瓜	Bow, Melon	radical, radical	Arc	Arc		<reading>こ</reading>				こ									Shoot a <radical>melon</radical> out of a <radical>bow</radical> and it will fly in a steep <kanji>arc</kanji>. Melons are too heavy to fly straight, after all.	Imagine shooting a really heavy melon out of a bow. Watch it make an arc through the air. Trace the arc with your finger.	Shooting melons in an <kanji>arc</kanji> is something little <ja><reading>子</reading></ja>'s (<ja>こ</ja>) love to do. It also helps that when they come down from the arc they smash all over the place.	Imagine being a <ja>子</ja> and watching melons fly in arcs all over.

What kind of challenge is it? If you look closely at your fingers sometimes you can figure out the challenge that is to come based on their movements.	In your finger, you see a <kanji>challenge</kanji>. And... if you look closely, you can see the fast movements of your fingers forming the outline of Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading>'s (<ja>ちょう</ja>) face. Oh no, the challenge is going to be Mrs. Chou!	Whenever you see an omen (radical), there's a good chance that Mrs. Chou will be a part of it. This is not a good sign.		6418	-	kanji Lesson_42
掘	Kanji	扌, 尸, 出	Fingers, Flag, Exit	radical, radical, radical	Dig	Dig		<reading>くつ</reading>	ほ			くつ	ほ								You see a <radical>flag</radical> near the <radical>exit</radical>, so you use your <radical>fingers</radical> to <kanji>dig</kanji> there. Most flags mark something, and this exit is pretty obvious, so there must be something under here. At least that's what you think to yourself as you dig.	Imagine digging under the flag by the exit of your building with your bare fingers. The dirt is getting under your fingernails as you dig. It's getting on your knees. It's everywhere.	"You <kanji>dig</kanji> until you finally hit something. It's a bunch of buried old <reading>coots</reading> (<ja>くつ</ja>). They're in an underground room for old coots. One yells up at you, ""Whatcha doing to our roof, ya whipper snapper?! Stop digging in our lawn!"""	You carefully un-dig the old coots and leave them to their old grumpy coot hole... basement... secret clubhouse? Whatever.		6419	-	kanji Lesson_42

If you don't have fingers, well, it's not so easy.	Hoist the sails! Hoist the anchor! Hoist a baby! All of these situations are easier if you have a ton of working fingers. (The more the better.)	Today, though, you have to <kanji>hoist</kanji> a bunch of <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>). It's for your job. And lucky for you, you have fingers so it's easy! But yogurt is still slippery and heavy. Oh, did I mention this yogurt isn't contained in anything? Good luck!	Imagine hoisting loose yogurt onto a ship. Feel it between your fingers and dripping onto your head as you hoist it above you. I hope you aren't lactose intolerant, cause it's getting all over you.		6420	-	kanji Lesson_42

Imagine picking up a few different things in a shop. If something fits nicely in your grip: buy it. If it's too small or too big, put it back.	You have a really strong <kanji>grip</kanji> thanks to <reading>acu</reading>puncture (<ja>あく</ja>)! All your fingers are primed for buying things. You can grip anything at a shop—pineapples, tires, even live turtles. All thanks to some well-placed needles.	Acupuncture is great for strengthening your grip strength.

Imagine being in space and shaking a satellite with your fingers.	You need to <kanji>shake</kanji> it because this satellite is full of <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>). And you only like yogurt that's been well shook. And who can resist space yogurt? Huh? Anyone?	Imagine shaking yogurt in space.

Two jackhammers running perfectly in sync will purify your body, mind, and soul! (And the ground around you that's being jackhammered.)	Close your eyes and feel the purification begin. Try not to let the loud jackhammering sound bother you, just focus on the simultaneous vibrations cleansing you inside and out.	This <kanji>purification</kanji> ritual is supposed to help you forget your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>). It's been a while, but you can't seem to get it out of your head.

It's just like that <kanji>temporarily</kanji>. You did make it permanent by taking an axe to your car, though.	Feel sad that you were the one to destroy your car for good, even though the sun messed it up temporarily. 	You were driving around in <reading>Zan</reading>zibar (<ja>ざん</ja>) when this happened, too, so now you're stuck in Zanzibar, a foreign place, and you have no idea what to do next.

To do the analysis on the tree, a cross section needs to be obtained, so you must chop it in half with your axe.

The person who is doing this <kanji>analysis</kanji> is very <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>). Who is this sexy person? Why it’s you of course, you sexy beast.

Then you set it off. BOOM. It explodes, but doesn't do what you'd expect. Instead of blowing the tree up, it blasts a very beautiful <kanji>pattern</kanji> into the side of it as well as the ground around it.	Think about what pattern it might be. Is it a checkered pattern? Something more complicated and beautiful? Whatever it is, think of something that really impresses you.	The <kanji>pattern</kanji> is so beautiful that you want to put it on your <reading>gara</reading>ge (<ja>がら</ja>). So, you do.

It doesn't come in and destroy everything. No, it comes in, goes inside your door, then stays at your place <kanji>overnight</kanji>, without even asking!	Imagine the white tsunami knocking on your door, walking into your house, and then just laying down on your bed. You try to tell it to leave, but it's a tsunami, and it says it will be staying overnight thank you very much.	Your cat walks up to the white tsunami that's staying <kanji>overnight</kanji> and decides it doesn't like it, so it <reading>hack</reading>s (<ja>はく</ja>) up a hairball on it.

Their legs keep spreading, so they try to jump, but that makes the slipping worse, and they go sliding forward and topple over their fluffy buns and onto your broken body.
