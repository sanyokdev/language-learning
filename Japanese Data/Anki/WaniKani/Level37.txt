The sun doesn't have a voice, unfortunately, so it calls out the only way it can, with its shining rays.	This <kanji>shining</kanji> is aimed directly at the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>).

The tsunami starts out in the middle of the ocean and pushes all the fish towards the coast where everyone does their fishing. With all the fish pushed closer to land and closer together, it’s very easy for people to go fishing in one spot and catch a lot of fish.	Imagine going fishing for fish in a fishing spot after a tsunami. There are SO many fish here. Your hook barely touches the water and there’s already a fish on it. Man, fishing like this is easy!

To get to the best <kanji>fishing</kanji> spot you need to <reading>go</reading> (<ja>ぎょ</ja>) <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) out to the middle of the ocean. You go by means of rowing. To get to the fish and do the fishing, you need to go and row out to sea.	Go! Go row! Go and row for the fishing! How do you go? You row! The row part should be pretty easy to remember since you gotta row your boat out to sea, but if you’re having trouble with the go part, just remember that it has the same reading as <ja>魚</ja>.		5656	-	kanji Lesson_37

The leader who presented you with this <kanji>reparation</kanji> is the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) of Japan. He's trying to make up for all the threats he made to you and some of the things you saw (which he's now trying to cover up for).	Imagine receiving your reparations from the Shougun himself.

You’re trying to recruit all the buildings in town and the greenhouse was the next on your list. It adds just a little bit of power to the town, but it's important nonetheless.	Imagine what you had to do to recruit this greenhouse. Imagine schmoozing with the previous greenhouse owners to recruit them to your cause and sell you the greenhouse.	After you <kanji>recruit</kanji> the greenhouse, you recruit <reading>Bo</reading>bo (<ja>ぼ</ja>) the clown to guard it for you. Bobo the clown has a terrifying amount of power so he’ll make an excellent guard for the greenhouse.	Recruit Bobo the clown. Look at him. He’s terrifying.

In other words, we're all in this circle/cycle where we do whatever we can to grab onto happiness and hold it as tightly as we can.	Be tenacious about happiness in your life. No matter how many times it slips away, don't give up. Keep going after it, because it will absolutely come back if you're tenacious enough.	Happiness is as <kanji>tenacious</kanji> as a <reading>shih tzu</reading> (<ja>しつ</ja>) with a <reading>shoe</reading> (<ja>しゅう</ja>). That little dog does not want to give up on the shoe, no matter what's happening around it.	Will someone take the shoe sometimes? Yeah, but the shih tzu doesn't give up.

Unfortunately, thanks to the explosion, the <kanji>base</kanji> is in <reading>rui</reading>ns (<ja>るい</ja>). It's dark and smokey and kinda half burned.
