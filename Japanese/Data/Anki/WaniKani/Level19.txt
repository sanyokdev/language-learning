The shot you fired sent the sun into a crazy chain reaction, making it implode in on itself and become a <radical>black hole</radical>. Imagine this happening and imagine the shock you'd feel. You shot the sun. You caused this infinite winter (and soon black hole death).					2949	-	Lesson_19 radical

加	Kanji	力, 口	Power, Mouth	radical, radical	Add	Add		<reading>か</reading>	くわ			か	くわ								Your <radical>mouth</radical> has the <radical>power</radical> to <kanji>add</kanji> words together to form a sentence. Marvel at the massive and mighty power your mouth holds! You add words together in an amazing fashion!	Say this sentence out loud. Incredible! You’ve used the power of your mouth to add words together in a sentence. Your parents must be very proud of you.	Your parents are so proud of you for using your powerful mouth to <kanji>add</kanji> words together that they decide to surprise you with a gift. It’s a new <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>). It’s that shiny brand new car that you’d always wanted. You’re speechless. However, your speechlessness frustrates your parents so they decide to take away the car they just gave you. Boo hoo.	Imagine how awful it would be to have a new car given to you only to have it taken away immediately after. Feel this rollercoaster of emotion as you are joyful and excited, then sad and sorrowful. 		2955	-	kanji Lesson_19

We've been putting these season stamps on bamboo, and later pretty much every perishable food, for a long, long time.	Picture yourself in a grocery store. You see a big pile of bamboo and pick each one up, checking the season stamps on their roots, to make sure you don't buy an old one.	These <kanji>season</kanji> stamps are marked on bamboo <reading>sets</reading> (<ja>せつ</ja>). You can't buy a single banana or a single grape, and just like that, if you want some nice seasonal bamboo, you have to buy them in sets.	How many bamboo sets will you be buying this season?

"How do your feelings decrease? Well, you have to hide your heart away in the aftermath of a tsunami. That's why the ""heart"" radical is missing from ""feeling""  💔"	This <kanji>decrease</kanji> in feelings from the terrible tsunami hits <reading>Gen</reading>ji (<ja>げん</ja>) the hardest. He's a very emotional man, so he usually feels things very strongly. When tsunami hit, well, his feelings decrease to nothing. 	Picture Genji, his feelings decrease down, down, down, until he's just a sad, beautiful shell of a person.		2957	-	kanji Lesson_19
順	Kanji	川, 頁	River, Geoduck	radical, radical	Order, Sequence	Order, Sequence		<reading>じゅん</reading>				じゅん									For a <radical>geoduck</radical> to make it into a <radical>river</radical>, it must know the <kanji>sequence</kanji> and <kanji>order</kanji> of water flow. Geoducks usually live in the ocean, not in a river, so they must study the order of water flow in order to determine the best sequence for making it into a river.	Imagine this geoduck mapping out a plan to get to the river. It’s studying the sequence and order of water flow. See it sitting there, reading a book, reading glasses and all. It’s quite odd.	After extensive study of the <kanji>sequence</kanji> and <kanji>order</kanji> of water, the geoduck has determined that <reading>June</reading> (<ja>じゅん</ja>) is the best time to travel to the river. June is the best time for the temperature and atmospheric pressure to be just right for such a journey. In June, the geoduck will set out.	June has arrived. Imagine the geoduck making its way from the ocean to the river. Use whatever makes you think of June to link that month to this scene of the geoduck making his way to the river.		2958	-	kanji Lesson_19

Its new <kanji>appearance</kanji> looks familiar to you, like it's a big <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>) cup! A valley with a roof on it looks exactly like a yogurt cup. Huh!	Now imagine this taking shape before your eyes and becoming actual yogurt! You grab a giant spoon and take a bite.		2959	-	kanji Lesson_19

They're always wet so towel cloth is all they know.	Picture a narwhal wrapped in a fuzzy towel blanket, with a towel tail cover, and some towel underpants. Everything is made of this type of cloth.	If you use this type of <kanji>cloth</kanji> for your clothes and blankets people will call you a <reading>foo</reading>l (<ja>ふ</ja>). They think you're a fool who can't tell the difference between human cloth and towel cloth.	"""You fool, you aren't a narwhal, that cloth isn't for you!"" they say. They're so mean."		2960	-	kanji Lesson_19

Geniuses can make loads of money out of pretty much anything, so shellfish are like easy-mode.	Picture the genius huddled over a pile of shellfish, muttering about all the wealth he'll amass once he's done.	The <kanji>wealth</kanji> comes pouring in, once the genius's <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>) is unveiled. It's a half-man, half-shellfish cyborg that's making him rich! It can even play the <reading>xy</reading>lophone (<ja>ざい</ja>)!	You'd be wealthy too if you sold that cyborg you made. It may not have any shellfish in it and it can't play the xylophone, but you could change that...		2962	-	kanji Lesson_19

Your body still works, you're happy, you have your entire life ahead of you! And everything smells like flowers.	Look to your right, if you see flowers (metaphorically, maybe) then you're still young. Congratulations!	When <kanji>young</kanji> people look to the left, they'll see their future: a <reading>walke</reading>r (<ja>わか</ja>). You know, those metal contraptions with tennis balls on the bottoms to make sure they don't scrape the floor. Everything may be flowers and happiness now, but your future is in a walker.	All young people have a walker looming just off to the side. A sign that your youth won't last forever, dear summer child.		2963	-	kanji Lesson_19

You're having trouble understanding this <kanji>part of speech</kanji>, so he's trying to help you. But you say it over and over and he keeps saying you're wrong.	"""Is it an adjective?"" ""No, that's the wrong part of speech."" ""Is it a verb?"" ""N-no! Of course not!"""	"The director asks you again, ""What is the part of speech for the word <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>)?"""	You stare blankly at him. What part of speech is that?! It's an animal, you know that. Oh! A noun. Duh.		2964	-	kanji Lesson_19
昆	Kanji	日, 比	Sun, Compare	radical, radical	Descendants	Descendants		<reading>こん</reading>				こん									If you <radical>compare</radical> the <radical>sun</radical> to its <kanji>descendants</kanji>, you’ll notice that the descendants don’t quite shine as brightly as the sun does. You don’t like to compare them, because each sun is special in its own way, but the descendants just aren’t quite as shiny as the original.	Look at the sun and its many descendant stars. Their light burns your eyes, making them water. Picture yourself squinting while you look at these many suns.	While you’re looking up at the sun and its <kanji>descendants</kanji>, trying to compare them to one another, a flock of <reading>con</reading>dors (<ja>こん</ja>) flies by, blocking out the sun. There’s a great many condors, and they manage to totally block out the light from the suns.	While you’re looking up at the condors, one of them poops in your eye. Imagine the shame and frustration you feel with condor poo in your eye as you hear the condors screech and flap their wings as they pass by.		2965	-	kanji Lesson_19
閥	Kanji	門, ｲ, 戈	Gate, Leader, Drunkard	radical, radical, radical	Clique, Clan	Clique, Clan		<reading>ばつ</reading>				ばつ									Passed out in front of the <radical>gate</radical> lies a <radical>drunkard</radical> who used to be the <radical>leader</radical> of a popular <kanji>clique</kanji>, the Cool Kids <kanji>Clan</kanji>. Once, he was a leader, but now he is but a drunkard. The clan has fallen apart, and he no longer has a clique to call his own.	Imagine this washed up drunkard leader passed out in front of the gate to your house. You have to pass him whenever you enter or exit your house. He’s gross and he smells. Experience the stench in your nostrils. How he was ever the leader of a clan you have no idea.	Eventually you get sick and tired of this washed up <kanji>clan</kanji> leader and you gather your own <kanji>clique</kanji> to chase this guy away from your gate and your property. You and your friends grab some <reading>bats</reading> (<ja>ばつ</ja>) and use these bats to beat the drunkard leader. Being beaten with bats frightens him, and he scurries away.	Hear the crushing blows of bats against flesh as you imagine this scene in your mind. You’re beating the crap out of this guy with a bunch of bats, but hey – he had it coming.		2966	-	kanji Lesson_19
歴	Kanji	厂, 木, 止	Cliff, Tree, Stop	radical, radical, radical	Continuation	Continuation		<reading>れき</reading>	へ			れき	へ								You <radical>stop</radical> at a <radical>cliff</radical> with a <radical>tree</radical> on it, realizing that <kanji>continuation</kanji> is impossible unless you find some way to bridge the gap to the other side of the cliff. The tree seems long enough to reach to the other side, but how are you going to chop it down?	Imagine yourself on this cliff. You desire a continuation for your journey, not wanting to stop here. Feel the strong wind on your body, blowing your hair about as you stand on the edge of the cliff. The leaves on the tree rustle in the breeze.	<kanji>Continuation</kanji> is impossible unless you chop this tree down to use as a bridge to cross to the other side of the cliff. You decide to use a <reading>wrecki</reading>ng (<ja>れき</ja>) ball. Luckily, there’s one right by you. So you take the wrecking ball and knock the tree over, making a bridge with it.	Picture yourself using the wrecking ball to knock down the tree on the cliff. Hear the chug of the wrecking ball engine as the tree cracks and splinters from the force of the wrecking ball.		2967	-	kanji Lesson_19
舌	Kanji	舌	Tongue	radical	Tongue	Tongue		ぜつ	<reading>した</reading>			した	ぜつ								The <radical>tongue</radical> radical and the <kanji>tongue</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Yee-haw!		You’re sound asleep in bed when your <kanji>tongue</kanji> drops out of your mouth and you start to drool, getting saliva all over the bed <reading>sheet</reading> (<ja>した</ja>). You wake up with a soggy patch of sheet near your mouth and wipe the drool off your face. Your significant other sees the whole thing.	Your significant other had been watching you sleep with your tongue out for a while now, so you're super embarrassed you wet the sheets with your nasty tongue drool. You feel very judged and embarrassed.		2968	-	kanji Lesson_19
冊	Kanji	冊	Bookshelf	radical	Book Counter, Counter For Books, Counter For Volumes	Book Counter, Counter For Books, Counter For Volumes		<reading>さつ</reading>				さつ									You use a <radical>bookshelf</radical> as a <kanji>book counter</kanji>. Duh. What are you gonna count them one by one? Okay, well maybe, but you should count them while they're nice and organized and on shelves. Otherwise counting is going to be a huge pain.	Imagine counting books on a bunch of bookshelves. One book, two book, red book, blue book!	While you were counting books using this <kanji>book counter</kanji> method, you got a bit tired and <reading>sat</reading> (<ja>さつ</ja>) down. But lucky for you, your books counter is a bookshelf, so just because you sat down doesn't mean you have to stop counting books.	You sat down, but the books can't stop you from counting them.		2969	-	kanji Lesson_19
宇	Kanji	宀, 干	Roof, Dry	radical, radical	Outer Space	Outer Space		<reading>う</reading>				う									You use a <radical>roof</radical> to keep yourself <radical>dry</radical> and safe from <kanji>outer space</kanji>. Look outside, above your roof, and you'll see outer space stretching above you.	You don't want to float up into outer space and get all wet, do you? No? Then you better make sure you have a roof above your head.	Why isn't it dry in <kanji>outer space</kanji>, you ask? Because of all the <reading>u</reading>ni (<ja>う</ja>) swimming around up there. They have nasty, wet, pointy spikes and they're all over the place.	Look closely up at outer space and you'll see all of the uni floating around up there. They're really dark, so it can be hard to notice them, but I promise you, they're there.		2970	-	kanji Lesson_19
宙	Kanji	宀, 由	Roof, Reason	radical, radical	Midair	Midair		<reading>ちゅう</reading>				ちゅう									You jumped off your <radical>roof</radical> for some <radical>reason</radical> and now you're floating in <kanji>midair</kanji>! You kick your legs a bit and move your arms like you're in water, but you're still just stuck there in midair.	At the moment you can't remember the reason you did it, but when you jumped off your roof you just floated in midair.	As you spin a bit in <kanji>midair</kanji> you look up and see <reading>Chew</reading>bacca (<ja>ちゅう</ja>) looking down at you from a spaceship. He's laughing his Chewbacca laugh and you realize he has you trapped in his tractor beam.	Oh Chewbacca, you lovable fuzzball. You better not drop me in midair, or I'll die.

Being busy just isn't good for your soul. Take breaks. Go on vacation. Don't be so busy that you destroy yourself.	Look around you. See all those busy people? Their souls are dying. Don't end up like them.	Take time out of your <kanji>busy</kanji> life and go <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) once in a while. In fact, you should probably go bowling once a week at least. Nothing brings energy back to your life like some relaxing bowling.	Think about your busy schedule this week. Now cancel everything and just go bowling instead.		2972	-	kanji Lesson_19

This flag marks (in the black hole) where you left your <kanji>boots</kanji>.	If you look into the black hole, you can see your boots right there, marked with the flag.	You grab your <kanji>boots</kanji> from the black hole. In your boots (thanks to the shelter they provided), some <reading>ree</reading>ds (<ja>り</ja>) have grown in!

Just stretch your mouth out and around every single person. Get 'em all in there.	I hope this group is full of people who enjoy being inside someone else's mouth, because they're gonna be pretty mad when you let them out if they aren't.	This <kanji>group</kanji> is so big it takes you till <reading>dawn</reading> (<ja>だん</ja>) to get your measurement: they weigh a <reading>ton</reading> (<ja>とん</ja>) too!	Imagine letting this group of, now very wet, people out of your mouth one by one. They don't seem to care that they weigh a ton!

They don’t mix well together. The sun loves to fight water and water loves to fight the sun. Lots and lots of violence.	Picture this violent fight scene in your brain. Imagine water locked in battle with the sun as the sun’s fire flares up and the water starts to sizzle.	But after a while, the sun and the water have had enough of <kanji>violence</kanji>. They decide to settle their differences with a friendly game of <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>). Bowling is a great way to relieve stress and in the end, they bond over it.	Imagine the sun and the water trying to bowl. Hear the sound of bowling balls rolling down the lane and pins rattling around and crashing together.		2975	-	kanji Lesson_19

If a tsunami is coming, it will likely get in the way of the sun.	Imagine the sun getting blocked out as a tsunami rises up from the ocean. Feel the cold fear of death on you as the tsunami approaches. That tsunami is gonna mix you up.	Just before the tsunami crashes over you, a <reading>con</reading>dor (<ja>こん</ja>) swoops out of the sky and grabs you up. This condor must be a <kanji>mix</kanji> – a normal condor is not strong enough to pick up a human. The condor must be mixed with something else. Like a pterodactyl.	Imagine yourself getting mixed up in this situation and the pterodactyl sized condor picking you up. Feel the condor’s talons digging into your shoulders as it grabs you up and flies you towards the sun.		2976	-	kanji Lesson_19

Nobody likes to get stabbed in the tongue with an umbrella, so they’re probably going to retaliate, and before you know it, you’ve a full scale riot on your hands. Look what you’ve done.	Imagine yourself getting stabbed in the tongue with an umbrella. It’s very painful. Taste the blood and metal in your mouth as this happens to you.	Just now you realize that the man you stabbed in the tongue with your umbrella was none other than Macho Man <reading>Ran</reading>dy Savage (<ja>らん</ja>). Being a professional wrestler, Macho Man Randy Savage is ready to throw down at a moment’s notice. A <kanji>riot</kanji> immediately erupts. It’s a battle royal with you and Randy at the epicenter.	Picture yourself squaring off with Macho Man Randy Savage in the middle of this riot. You have the advantage of having an umbrella, but Randy has the advantage of being himself.

They’re escaping from a sticky situation involving Nazis and Junior was just loitering around like a fool. It’s no time to loiter, it’s time to run!	Imagine Sean Connery saying “Don’t loiter – run, Junior!” and you should have a much easier time remembering this phrase if you remember it in his voice.	Deciding not to loiter any longer, Indiana Jones <kanji>Junior</kanji> takes his dad’s advice and starts to run. Unfortunately he wasn’t paying attention to where his feet were and he stubbed his <reading>to</reading>e (<ja>と</ja>) on a jagged rock. His toe is in so much pain that he can’t bear to run any longer and gets overtaken by the Nazis that were chasing them.	Imagine yourself as Indiana Jones Junior and this happened to you.

When you loiter around like that it looks like you're waiting for something, so if someone puts something in your hands and you just happen to acquire it, well, no one can fault you for that.	Imagine loitering around near the sun temple. Maybe you acquire some illegal goods, maybe you just acquire a tan (it is a SUN temple, after all). 	"You managed to <kanji>acquire</kanji> some tobacco, but just as you're about to leave <reading>Toku</reading>gawa (<ja>とく</ja>) Ieyasu comes marching up to you!! Or at least, his ghost does. He stares you dead in the eyes and says, ""I didn't found the shogunate for you to acquire illegal goods and kill your body toking on my soil."""	Your eyes fill with tears under Tokugawa's gaze and you drop everything you acquired to the ground. You bow before him apologizing. You'll never do this again!		2979	-	kanji Lesson_19

Imagine sitting in your house all winter, meditating and thinking about how you can renew yourself.	Winter ends and, <kanji>renew</kanji>ed, you come out ready to start a new hobby: <reading>ka</reading>yaking (<ja>かい</ja>)! Nothing says renewal like a brand new kayak and sense of purpose in life.

This poor sheep lost his horns and now feels quite sad. Sheep don’t have hands, so the sheep had to pick the horns up off the ground with his mouth. An evil doctor would just murder the sheep and steal his horns, so the sheep must find a morally good doctor to reaffix them.	Imagine yourself as the good doctor being approached by this forlorn sheep without horns. Hear the clack of the horns together as the sheep drops them out of his mouth onto the ground and lets out a pathetic bleat. “Baa~aa~ah~”	Since you are a <kanji>morally good</kanji> doctor, you decide not to murder the sheep and harvest its organs.
