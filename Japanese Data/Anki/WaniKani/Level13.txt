Smashing your mouth into a gate is going to hurt. A lot. The problem you’re now in is one of getting to a hospital and having your mouth sewn back on.	Imagine having your mouth bashed into a gate. It’s going to hurt. Imagine how painful this would be and how problematic it is.	The reason you ran mouth first into this gate was because you were being chased by a <reading>mon</reading>ster (<ja>もん</ja>). A monster in and of itself is a big enough <kanji>problem</kanji> as is, let alone smashing your mouth into a gate. You poor, hapless soul.	Monsters are scary.

You sit down in front of the tree with its eye heart and stare at it, trying to understand the concept it's trying to express. Concepts are too abstract. This is hard.	After a few hours of contemplating this <kanji>concept</kanji>, suddenly it becomes clear and a <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>) pops out of the tree.

Right after you've finished <kanji>arrang</kanji>ing the bundles, you take out your <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) and do one final slice. All of the bundles are now perfectly organized AND cut.	You can't just throw an entire bundle of logs onto a fire, you have to saber them into smaller chunks.

The two suns are very bright and standing right next to each other, so all the area will be lit up and nothing will be dark.	Think of how bright the sun is. Now multiply that by two. Suns are especially bright right after you come out of a dark area. Imagine yourself looking at these suns and feeling the pain as your eyes are blinded by the bright light.	Since the sun has blinded you, your vision is now very <kanji>dark</kanji>. You can’t see anything, but you are hungry so you reach around for some food and eat it. Yuck! It’s <reading>an</reading>chovies (<ja>あん</ja>). You don’t even like anchovies, how did they get in your house?	Picture yourself eating anchovies. The anchovies taste particularly fishy and salty.

Someone who has a formal name title has a different manner of doing things."	Picture how Sir Wilburt Coddington III obtained his formal name title. He must have done some pretty amazing things, even for a sheep. Just imagine the feats he must have accomplished.	This sheep with the <kanji>formal name title</kanji> of Sir Wilburt Coddington III only likes to play outside in the water during the <reading>summer</reading> (<ja>さま</ja>). Summer is the best season for this fancy sheep. The other seasons just can’t compare.	Imagine playing in the water in the summer.

This holy tree from heaven was sent down to earth to cross this very bridge. It is the tree’s angelic mission. Also the tree has a mouth and a mustache.	Picture this majestic tree as it crosses the bridge. Its mustache is very distinguished. Hear its roots and branches swaying, creaking, and cracking in the wind.	The tree finishes crossing the <kanji>bridge</kanji> and on the other side is a plate of steaming <reading>hash</reading> (<ja>はし</ja>) browns! That's why it has a mouth. To eat yummy bridge hash browns.	Imagine sitting on the bridge with the tree and eating hash browns with it. It's heavenly! 		2004	-	kanji Lesson_13

Crows won't hang out in your farm. Everything you grow will become large and delicious. But not everyone is so lucky that a spirit will decide to live in their scarecrow. So maybe the luck was in you all along!	Nope, the luck is definitely coming from the spirit in your scarecrow. You aren't lucky on your own.	"You want to check the scarecrow to make sure your recent <kanji>luck</kanji> is coming from it, so you kick it. ""<reading>F***</reading> (<ja>ふく</ja>) you!"" it yells. Oh yeah, there's a spirit in there."	If you get a luck spirit to say f*** you, you might accidentally convince it to move somewhere else. If it does, you lose your luck.

Wolverines love green thread. Almost as much as they love the water.	Picture this wolverine playing with the green thread. It’s like a little kitten with yarn. That wolverine loves that green thread. Picture how cute it is as it plays with the thread and coos in happiness.	<reading>Midori</reading> (<ja>みどり</ja>) is a <kanji>green</kanji> colored melon liqueur with a sweet, fruity taste. This wolverine is too young to drink alcohol like Midori, so he just sticks to drinking water.	If you’ve ever had Midori before, imagine that taste. It’s also green, so that’s an easy way to remember this kanji. If you haven’t had it, just picture the taste of melon and imagine that flavor on your tongue.		2006	-	kanji Lesson_13

You’ve discovered a method to tell direction using just a thread, so you point it to the east in order to find your way. The method takes practice though, so you’re sure to practice every day.	East is the land of the rising sun, so imagine yourself practicing this method, pointing the thread to the east as the sun rises up. Feel the heat of the sun’s rays and see the bright light as the sun shines up over the horizon.	Also, you are <reading>Ren</reading> (<ja>れん</ja>), from Ren & Stimpy the TV show. Since you’re not in the TV business anymore, you’ve decided to <kanji>practice</kanji> your other skills. How mature of you, Ren.

It has to be a poem, because if you say anything else it's just plain disrespectful. All of the monks and priests at this temple have to read and recite poems all day, and if they can do it forever, you can while you're visiting.	Picture all of the people at the temple reciting poems together. You join in too, and it's a really powerful moment!	As you recite a long <kanji>poem</kanji> at the temple you see a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) in the crowd. It's opening and closing its mouth like it wants to say the poem too.	You turn to the person next to you and realize you have to say everything in poem form.  Excuse me I'm not a creep so hear my plea is that a sheep?		2008	-	kanji Lesson_13
銀	Kanji	金, 艮	Gold, Root	radical, radical	Silver	Silver		<reading>ぎん</reading>				ぎん									At the <radical>root</radical> of <radical>gold</radical>, there is <kanji>silver</kanji>. Gold is basically just silver leveled up. That's why gold is first place, and silver is second. If you just scratch gold really good, you'll find that at its root, there's silver hidden just underneath.	Imagine taking a gold coin and rubbing it with some soap and water. As you rub, you slowly see that it's really silver underneath. Huh!	If you want to hunt for some <kanji>silver</kanji> for yourself, all you need is a <reading>gui</reading>nea (<ja>ぎん</ja>) pig. Guinea pigs can smell silver, so get a couple and set them loose in the woods and they'll lead you straight to it.	Guinea pigs are to silver as normal pigs are to truffles.		2009	-	kanji Lesson_13

The law says that all bears are allowed to eat on the roofs of public buildings. In Japan at least, I don't know where bears are supposed to eat in wherever you're from.	Picture a public building, like a museum or a library, and look at the roof. There's a bear eating up there! And it's smiling and waving to you!	All <kanji>public building</kanji>s must serve bear needs thanks to the monumental law passed by Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>). Genghis Khan knew that bears weren't treated well by humans, so he made sure all public buildings were at least partially bear accessible.	"The next time you see a public building, think, ""Thank you Genghis Khan."" Because of him bears are free to go up to the roof and eat whatever they please whenever they please.

""Perhaps <reading>a key</reading> (<ja>えき</ja>) would help?"" asks the station master, as he goes over to open the door to the train."	"Instead of saying ""a key"" he says ""eh key."" How strange. Imagine the station master saying it like this with his weird accent. You ask him if he has ""a key"" and he replies with, ""What is a key?"" Then you say ""eh key."" He totally understands you now."		2012	-	kanji Lesson_13

Imagine a hundred million free puppies. That’s a lot. Imagine playing with all of them. You’d be pretty happy. Unless you hate puppies. Then you’d be pretty unhappy, I imagine.	The cult leader has his headquarters in <reading>Ok</reading>lahoma (<ja>おく</ja>). Are there a <kanji>hundred million</kanji> people in Oklahoma? No, probably not.

Imagine yourself stuffing all of these big products into their respective containers.	Once you get the big products into a <kanji>container</kanji>, you then lock it with a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). You wouldn’t want these products to bust out of their containers, so it’s best to lock them up with a key.	Imagine the size of these big keys you have to use to lock these containers.

Imagine ladling up a nice big scoop of rice and then seeing the little fee ladle next to it. Ugh. The material fee.	One day, the <kanji>fee</kanji> ladle is suddenly the size of row (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat oars! What! You're supposed to pay a row boat sized fee now?!
