土	Radical				Dirt	Dirt, Grave															There's a cross drawn on the ground, making this <radical>dirt</radical>. You can draw anything in the dirt, it just happens to be a cross this time. Imagine drawing a cross in the dirt with your finger. Feel the dirt get stuck under your fingernail and never forget.					85	-	Lesson_2 radical
刀	Radical				Sword	Sword															If you look at this radical, it looks like the bottom part of a <radical>sword</radical>—the handle, more specifically. This radical also looks a lot like the power radical (<ja>力</ja>), so don't get them confused. It's missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword radical is 90% of the power radical).					86	-	Lesson_2 radical
ナ	Radical				Narwhal	Narwhal															"This radical looks like the katakana character <ja>ナ</ja> (na), which we're going to say stands for <radical>narwhal</radical>. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Oh, and don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (<ja>ナ</ja>) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (<ja>メ</ja>), like an ""X."""					87	-	Lesson_2 radical
丁	Radical				Street	Street, Nail															There's a barb under the ground, holding it in place. This is actually a <radical>street</radical>. All streets have to be secured to the ground with barbs so that they don't slide all over the place. If you tried to pick up the asphalt streets we have today, you'd still find barbs under the ground to keep them there. The more you know! ⭐					88	-	Lesson_2 radical
儿	Radical				Legs	Legs															This radical already looks like a pair of <radical>legs</radical>. There's even feet on these legs (unlike the fins radical, which you learned earlier). That's how you know these are legs and not fins (or something else).					89	-	Lesson_2 radical
冂	Radical				Head	Head															"This is the kind of <radical>head</radical> a child might draw—can you imagine it with eyes, nose, mouth, and ears too? Whoever's head this is, it's really square. Maybe it's the head of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)"" target=""_blank"">famous spongy cartoon character</a>. Hmm."					90	-	Lesson_2 radical
又	Radical				Stool	Stool															This looks just like a fold-out <radical>stool</radical>, amiright?					91	-	Lesson_2 radical
メ	Radical				Treasure	Treasure															"This radical is <radical>treasure</radical> because ""X marks the spot,"" as they say. Doesn't it look like the X on a pirate treasure map? You want to go find that treasure now, right?!"					92	-	Lesson_2 radical
千	Radical				Thousand	Thousand, 1000, 1,000															"You're in a room, surrounded by slides. Down off the slides tumble cross after cross after cross. They're bouncing in and hitting you in the face, the arm, everywhere... With each cross comes a voice yelling, ""ONE! TWO! THREE HUNDRED! FIVE HUNDRED!"" and so on. You are worried it will never end, because you're starting to drown in the crosses. Then the voice yells out ONE <radical>THOUSAND</radical> and they stop. Still, you can't move. Think about all the numbers being called out, and keep wondering if it'll be the last one. Feel the relief you'd feel if it stops on a thousand, because you won't be buried anymore. The thousand crosses are covering you entirely, over your head, but because they're crosses you can still breathe."					93	-	Lesson_2 radical
夕	Radical				Evening	Evening															Do you see the prison and drop radicals making up this radical? This prison is holding onto a drop because it's the <radical>evening</radical>. Evening air does a better job of holding on to drops of liquid like this, which is why everything is covered in dew in the morning.					94	-	Lesson_2 radical
子	Radical				Child	Child															This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, whom (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want your <radical>child</radical> to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine.					95	-	Lesson_2 radical
小	Radical				Small	Small															You have fins and you have a barb. A fish that you can stick an entire barb through like this would have to be really <radical>small</radical>, since it's sticking through the whole fish body (which you can imagine by basing the body off the size of the fins compared to the already small barb.)					96	-	Lesson_2 radical
弓	Radical				Bow	Bow, Spring															This radical looks like a fancy composite <radical>bow</radical> people would use to shoot at targets and definitely not any normal living animals. See how the middle part is being pulled back? Imagine holding this bow and firing it at a target shaped like a giant alligator-crab monster.					97	-	Lesson_2 radical
尸	Radical				Flag	Flag															See the <radical>flag</radical> in this radical? There's a pole with a flag on the end of it, blowing in the wind. Basically, this radical looks just like a flag.					98	-	Lesson_2 radical
彡	Radical				Hair	Hair															These three streaks flowing off to the side are three strands of hair. Pretty easy to see and remember, right?					99	-	Lesson_2 radical
五	Radical				Five	Five, 5															"If you use your imagination, this radical actually looks like the number ""5."" You have to remove the vertical line in the bottom left, but once you do that, you have an easy way to remember that this radical means <radical>five</radical>."					100	-	Lesson_2 radical
天	Radical				Heaven	Heaven															There is a two radical and a person radical. The first level of a person's life is on earth. The second level (this level, which is why there's a two radical here) is in heaven. So when you see a person at level 2, you know they're in <radical>heaven</radical>.					101	-	Lesson_2 radical
手	Radical				Hand	Hand															This one's a little tough to picture, but I believe in you. The barb in the middle is the wrist/arm. Then, there are four regular fingers coming off of it and then one big thumb (the slide radical at the top). So you have four fingers, a thumb, and a wrist. This is what makes up your crazy looking <radical>hand</radical>.					102	-	Lesson_2 radical
文	Radical				Writing	Writing, Doll															This looks like a stool with a lid on it, but it's actually a <radical>writing</radical> desk. Do you see it? It's a nice, quiet place for writing. You can even see the pen sticking up in the middle. Wouldn't you want to do your writing here?					103	-	Lesson_2 radical
月	Radical				Moon	Moon															The <radical>moon</radical> is actually made of the sun, but it has little legs coming off of it leaning towards the left. Why? Because the moon is always running away from the sun as fast as it can. It doesn't want to get caught on fire, so it has to run to stay ahead!					104	-	Lesson_2 radical
止	Radical				Stop	Stop															There's a giant toe and a stick in the ground in front of you. You're driving your car toward them, but you don't see them until your lights hit them. What would these things cause you to do? Most likely <radical>stop</radical> your car right away.					105	-	Lesson_2 radical
水	Radical				Water	Water															There are drops of liquid coming out of both sides of this barb. You can imagine the barb being stuck into the ground then pulled out. When it is, <radical>water</radical> comes gushing out of both sides! That's why this radical is water.					106	-	Lesson_2 radical
火	Radical				Fire	Fire															See the person radical here? It's got things coming off of it... what are those things—OH MY GOD IT'S <radical>FIRE</radical>!!! Help, help! Put the fire out!					107	-	Lesson_2 radical
犬	Radical				Dog	Dog															Remember the big guy that helped you remember the big radical? Now the big guy has something on his shoulder... what is that? You look and see that he has a <radical>dog</radical> up there, perched as if it were a parrot or a cat or something. Dogs aren't supposed to be up on people's shoulders like that, but for him? It works!					108	-	Lesson_2 radical
王	Radical				King	King															This radical is not something anyone can have. Only a <radical>king</radical> can wear this crown upon his head. This radical is the sign of kings. Imagine your favorite king wearing this on their head. It's a pretty distinctive shape—I think you can do it.					109	-	Lesson_2 radical
中	Radical				Middle	Middle															There's a stick going right through the <radical>middle</radical> of someone's mouth! Imagine that mouth being yours. Measure the placement of the stick. Perfectly aligned, right in the middle. That's amazing, though to be honest, you probably have bigger problems than measuring the location of this stick in your mouth.					110	-	Lesson_2 radical
本	Radical				Book	Book, Real															There's a cut right at the base of this tree. Why would someone cut down a tree? To make a <radical>book</radical> out of it! Imagine living in the old days when you'd have to cut down a tree yourself to write or read a book.					111	-	Lesson_2 radical
田	Radical				Rice Paddy	Rice Paddy															Rice paddies are made up of fields with irrigation lines going between them. See the four rice paddies with water flowing between and around them? That's why this radical is <radical>rice paddy</radical>.					112	-	Lesson_2 radical
白	Radical				White	White															Add a drop of the sun to something and it will turn it <radical>white</radical>. The sun is really strong, so even a single drop will burn anything white. Why do you think so many beaches are white? Even the drops of sunblock you use to stop the sun's rays is white. So when you think of sun drops, think white.					113	-	Lesson_2 radical
目	Radical				Eye	Eye															See the iris in the middle of the eyeball? Remember that there are no round things in kanji, so square things take their place. That makes this a pretty realistic, square <radical>eye</radical>. You just have to squint with your real eyes a bit.					114	-	Lesson_2 radical
石	Radical				Stone	Stone															There's a leaf growing out of a square thing (which is normally a mouth, but not this time). The leaf is growing out of a <radical>stone</radical>. I mean, obviously, because leaves don't grow out of mouths. I hope. Anyway, Picture a stone in the middle of nature with a leaf growing out of it or just behind it and you'll never forget this radical!					115	-	Lesson_2 radical
立	Radical				Stand	Stand															Two sticks are propping up a lid. By doing this, they're making it <radical>stand</radical> up.					116	-	Lesson_2 radical
牛	Radical				Cow	Cow															There's a cross and a gun, with the gun going through the cross. You're using the cross to stabilize your gun, because you need to shoot a <radical>cow</radical> for dinner. You bring your cross because you need to bless the cow once you've killed it (and it's also a good stand for your gun). Poor cow.					117	-	Lesson_2 radical
ム	Radical				Private	Private, Pile															This is a little triangle that's almost completely closed off. When you want to be alone, you hide in a place where you can be in <radical>private</radical>. That's why this is the private radical. You're closing yourself off to the rest of the world, with just a little peephole.					118	-	Lesson_2 radical
刀	Kanji	刀	Sword	radical	Sword, Katana	Sword, Katana		<reading>とう</reading>	かたな			とう	かたな								The radical and the meaning of this kanji are almost the same! The radical is <radical>sword</radical>, but we're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese <kanji>sword</kanji>? That's right, the most common is a <kanji>katana</kanji>, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.	"The progression on this one is important. When you think ""sword"" you have to think, ""What kinds of swords do Japanese people have?"" Then you'll reach the meaning of this kanji on your own."	So now you have this sweet <kanji>katana</kanji> in your hands and you're swinging it around like an idiot. Feel free to make whooshing noises as you swing it around. To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja> (That's Tokyo!). <ja>とうきょう</ja> has the best sword and katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to <ja>とうきょう</ja>.	Imagine trying to travel to <ja>とうきょう</ja> with your katana. Airport security is not happy with you trying to take a katana on the plane, so you get a full cavity search. I hope you don't have any other swords hidden anywhere.		119	-	kanji Lesson_2
土	Kanji	土	Dirt	radical	Dirt, Soil, Earth, Ground	Dirt, Soil, Earth, Ground		<reading>ど</reading> <reading>と</reading>	つち			ど, と	つち								The <radical>dirt</radical> radical and the <kanji>dirt</kanji> kanji are the same!	As long as you know the radical dirt, you know the kanji dirt.	Who spends a lot of time in <kanji>dirt</kanji>? <reading>Do</reading>gs (<ja>ど</ja>) do! Dogs dig in dirt, they roll in dirt, sometimes they try to eat dirt (which isn't so great).	Dogs and dirt just go together!		120	-	kanji Lesson_2
千	Kanji	千	Thousand	radical	Thousand	Thousand, 1000, 1,000		<reading>せん</reading>	ち			せん	ち								This kanji looks like and means the same thing as the radical, which makes it particularly easy to remember.	As long as you know the radical <radical>thousand</radical> then you know the kanji <kanji>thousand</kanji> as well!	"Remember the thousand crosses you got stuck under while learning the radical <ja>千</ja>? You're still under it. Then, suddenly, someone pops his head over you and says ""Hey, I'll save you... but only for a <kanji>thousand</kanji> <reading>cents</reading> (<ja>せん</ja>). Go ahead and try to calculate what that would come out to. It's not that expensive, actually."	But, the problem is even though you have a <kanji>thousand</kanji> <reading>cents</reading> in your pocket, you can't get them out. You're stuck under all these crosses. So, your savior just shrugs and runs off, he won't help you anymore. Feel the desperateness of the situation to help yourself remember the kanji better. Hear the coins falling on the ground.		121	-	kanji Lesson_2
夕	Kanji	夕	Evening	radical	Evening	Evening		せき	<reading>ゆう</reading>			ゆう	せき								The <radical>evening</radical> radical and the <kanji>evening</kanji> kanji are the same. If you know the radical you know the meaning of the kanji.	Do what you're meant to do. Study those radicals!	The <kanji>evening</kanji> is when all the <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>) come outside to play.	"Young people love staying up the entire evening doing youth-people things, and it's really obnoxious for us curmudgeonly folk.  Note: All the <ja>ゆう</ja> readings will use the word ""youths"" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these ""youths"" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world, just like how people treat millennials nowadays."		122	-	kanji Lesson_2
子	Kanji	子	Child	radical	Child, Kid	Child, Kid		<reading>し</reading> <reading>す</reading>	こ			し, す	こ								The <radical>child</radical> radical and the <kanji>child</kanji> kanji are exactly the same.	So, if you know your radicals, you know your kanji as well! This won't last forever (where radicals are exactly the same as the kanji) so enjoy it while the kanji are still small and simple!	To remember the sounds  <ja>し</ja> and <ja>す</ja> we'll use these mnemonics:  There is a <kanji>child</kanji> standing in front of you. You look closely at the child but something seems wrong. You rub your eyes and when you open them again there is a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) in a <reading>sui</reading>t (<ja>す</ja>) in front of you. You yelp, blink, and it's back to being a child. Are... all children really just sheep in suits?!	The child runs away and you chase after it. Every time it's about to turn a corner it looks like a sheep in a suit again, but whenever you yell and point, it turns back. You're the only one who can see this sheep suit child!!		123	-	kanji Lesson_2
小	Kanji	小	Small	radical	Small, Little	Small, Little		<reading>しょう</reading>	ちい こ お			しょう	ちい, こ, お								The <radical>small</radical> radical and the <kanji>small</kanji> kanji are exactly the same.	Knowing radicals sure is nice, huh?	This <kanji>small</kanji> kanji would be the perfect gift to give to the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>). The Shougun loves little things, and the <kanji>little</kanji> kanji represents all of that.	You read that right, shougun is written with a long <ja>う</ja> sound. Make sure you spell it right from now on!		124	-	kanji Lesson_2
丁	Kanji	丁	Street	radical	Street	Street		<reading>ちょう</reading> <reading>てい</reading>				ちょう, てい									The kanji and the radical that look like this are exactly the same. They are both <kanji>street</kanji>.	As long as you know the radical street, you know the kanji street.	So you're walking down this <kanji>street</kanji>, and off in the distance you see the silhouette of somebody. A lady. Big, black curly hair and red eyes. It is the <kanji>street</kanji>-woman, Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>).	"Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> is a character you'll see a lot throughout WaniKani, anytime the reading is <ja>ちょう</ja> like this one. A lore will develop around her, so the more vividly you can imagine your Mrs. Chou right now, the easier things will get later. In general, she's a mean, evil woman, so as long as you imagine her within those parameters, you're good. And, when I say she is a ""street-woman"" in the mnemonic, I don't mean she is homeless. She has a nice, middle-class home that's not outside of her financial means. What I'm saying is she wanders the streets looking for evil things to do. These are HER streets. So whenever you see the street radical, know that Mrs. Chou is probably going to show up!"		125	-	kanji Lesson_2
了	Kanji	亅	Barb	radical	Finish, Complete, End	Finish, Complete, End		<reading>りょう</reading>				りょう									Think about it this way. There is a famous fishing lure inventor, working on his best work ever. He’s old, and he’s been trying to make the best fishing lure for the last 50 years, and knows this will be his last invention. Then he figures it out. He takes one <radical>barb</radical>, and connects the end of it to the top of another <radical>barb</radical>. When he does this, he knows his work is finally <kanji>finish</kanji>ed.	Make sure you look at this amazing fishing lure too - hold it in your hand, see the two barbs fused together. Think about how strange this lure is. Is this really the best in the world? Will this really finish all other fishing lures?	How does the fish lure maker test his newly <kanji>finish</kanji>ed lure out? The one he just finished? He gets in a <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat and rows out into the sea.	Make him think that he can’t just use his new lure on the side of the lake / ocean / whatever. He has to get out there, but unfortunately all he has is a crappy row boat. Imagine the row boat being terrible, leaky, and dangerous, which is why you’re surprised when he goes for it. That’s a terrible row boat to use! If you do this, you'll focus your mind on the rowboat part of things, which will help you to remember the reading of this kanji.		126	-	kanji Lesson_2
又	Kanji	又	Stool	radical	Again	Again			<reading>また</reading>			また									You're sitting on your <radical>stool</radical> <kanji>again</kanji>!!?	Imagine your super comfy, state-of-the-art stool. You take it everywhere with you, and you're always sitting on it. Again, and again, and <kanji>again</kanji>. You love that stool.	"Your friends are starting to worry about you, because you're always sitting on that stool. ""What is the <reading>matter</reading> (<ja>また</ja>)  with you?"" they scream! You might want to imagine that all your friends have Jamaican and/or British accents to make this one fit a bit better!"	"Imagine your friends getting more and more annoyed with your constant stool-sitting habits! They really don't get it. What is the matter with you?! Why can't you just stand like everyone else? Don't you know sitting is the ""new smoking""!?"		127	-	kanji Lesson_2
丸	Kanji	九, 丶	Nine, Drop	radical, radical	Circle, Circular, Round	Circle, Circular, Round		がん	<reading>まる</reading>			まる	がん								What's something with <radical>nine</radical> sides? Just add a <radical>drop</radical> and you'll have something that's almost a <kanji>circle</kanji>.	It's not quite a <kanji>circle</kanji> though. You just need to add a <radical>drop</radical> of liquid to the edges to smooth it out to become a full circle.	"Do you know about the adorable cat Maru? If not, you should <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_AbfPXTKms"" target=“_blank”>check it out</a>. May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worth while.  When you think about a circle, think about <reading>Maru</reading> all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.  Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to ""Maru."""	"Obviously if you ""don't know this reading"" well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos. I'll understand... just make sure you come back someday, okay?"		128	-	kanji Lesson_2
才	Kanji	一, 亅, 丿	Ground, Barb, Slide	radical, radical, radical	Genius	Genius		<reading>さい</reading>				さい									On the <radical>ground</radical> you put <radical>barb</radical>s at the bottom of a <radical>slide</radical> because you're a <kanji>genius</kanji> trying to catch another <kanji>genius</kanji>.	Imagine yourself placing the barbs in front of the slide, thinking about how your genius plan will surely catch another genius.	You check your <kanji>genius</kanji> trap, and there's a genius stuck in the barbs! You know it's a genius because they're actually a <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>).	Cyborgs have brain implants, so they're definitely all geniuses.		129	-	kanji Lesson_2
中	Kanji	中	Middle	radical	Middle, In, Inside, Center	Middle, In, Inside, Center		<reading>ちゅう</reading>	なか			ちゅう	なか								The radical <radical>Middle</radical> and the kanji <kanji>Middle</kanji> are both the same. So if you know one, you know the other.	Make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise you might find yourself in the middle of a kanji-learning problem.	To remember the reading for this kanji, we use the word <reading>Chew</reading>bacca to pull up <ja>ちゅう</ja> in our memory.   If you remember back to the radical <ja>中</ja>, the <kanji>middle</kanji> of your mouth was stabbed with a stick. You look up to see who did it. There stands <reading>Chew</reading>bacca, doing his Chewbacca yell. And it isn't a stick in your mouth, it's an arrow from his crossbow (a bowcaster, actually). It just so happens Chewbacca's bowcaster looks just like this kanji too. Go figure.	Imagine the fear and shock you'd feel after finding out it was Chewbacca who shot the middle of your mouth (and head). Touch his fur. Look really close at his weapon. Give him a sniff, too. Just so that memory never fades away.		130	-	kanji Lesson_2
五	Kanji	五	Five	radical	Five	Five, 5		<reading>ご</reading>	いつ			ご	いつ								The <radical>five</radical> radical and the <kanji>five</kanji> kanji are the same.	Know your radicals, friend-o.	<kanji>Five</kanji> is the number of buildings <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>) will knock down. Oh, look! There he goes now.	One, two, three, four, five—GODZILLA IS HERE GO GO, RUN!		131	-	kanji Lesson_2
六	Kanji	亠, ハ	Lid, Fins	radical, radical	Six	Six, 6		<reading>ろく</reading>	む			ろく	む								Just imagine a beast with a <radical>lid</radical> for a head and <radical>fins</radical> for feet, running around looking as insane as possible (really imagine it!). When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number <kanji>six</kanji> is the devil's number.	Imagine this beast doing various crazy things, the crazier the better (to help you remember). Make sure all these things are associated with the devil and the devil's number (<kanji>six</kanji>), so you can remember the meaning of this kanji.	Whenever we need to remember the reading <ja>ろく</ja> we just use the word <reading>rock</reading>.   So, think about the devil and the devil's number. What is often associated with those things? Why, <reading>rock</reading> (<ja>ろく</ja>) and roll is. Imagine the lid-head fin-legged beast suddenly blasting out rock music in the middle of his destructive mayhem.	Sing along with the monster, if it helps you to remember the reading of this kanji.		132	-	kanji Lesson_2
円	Kanji	冂, 亠	Head, Lid	radical, radical	Yen, Round, Circle	Yen, Round, Circle		<reading>えん</reading>	まる			えん	まる								The combination of radicals for this kanji may not be obvious at first, but if you look carefully you'll see it. The <radical>lid</radical> is inside the <radical>head</radical> for this kanji because it's holding something in. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of <kanji>yen</kanji> coins, the currency of Japan!	Another thing that will help is to associate the word <kanji>round</kanji> to this kanji, because it has both of these meanings. Both are right, and if you learn one that's better than not learning either, but maybe if you think about how round the coins themselves are inside this person's head, you'll remember this one too.	"What does the word <kanji>yen</kanji> sound like? It sounds like <ja>えん</ja>. Why? because back in the day, Japanese used to have a ""ye"" sound, but now it doesn't. Instead, it's an ""e"" sound, which is why yen = <ja><reading>えん</reading></ja>!"	Picture these <kanji>round</kanji> <ja>えん</ja> in your mind. Maybe look some up online too, just to be safe.		133	-	kanji Lesson_2
天	Kanji	天	Heaven	radical	Heaven	Heaven		<reading>てん</reading>	あま			てん	あま								The radical <radical>heaven</radical> is the same as the kanji <kanji>heaven</kanji>, making this an easy kanji to memorize.	If you know your radicals well (and you should!) you know the meaning of this kanji well, as well!	<kanji>Heaven</kanji>... nowadays, people aren't all that good. Things have gotten bad. That's why the acceptance rate to get into heaven is only <reading>ten</reading> (<ja>てん</ja>) percent!	Imagine yourself in line to get into heaven. You're super worried, because you're not sure if you'll get in. You heard there was a one in <reading>ten</reading> chance... those aren't good odds. Feel nervous in your imagination. Feel worried. Feel the pressure as you get closer and closer to the gate... will you make it?? Ten percent!		134	-	kanji Lesson_2
手	Kanji	手	Hand	radical	Hand	Hand		しゅ ず	<reading>て</reading>			て	しゅ, ず								The <radical>hand</radical> radical and the <kanji>hand</kanji> kanji are identical in looks and meaning! That should make things easy!	Make sure you're studying your radicals. It won't be forever that radicals and kanji overlap so nicely like this!	"To remember the reading <ja>て</ja> we will use the word ""Television."" You have great hands. Go ahead and look at them. OH MY GOD. You have little <reading>te</reading>levisions (<ja>て</ja>) on your hands. They are playing the dumbest show you can think of, too, both hands at the same time."	You try to shake your hands off, but it's no good. The televisions are stuck, and the volume won't go down. You have no idea how you got these televisions on your hands. All you know is that you want them off right this instant.		135	-	kanji Lesson_2
文	Kanji	文	Writing	radical	Writing, Sentence	Writing, Sentence		<reading>ぶん</reading> <reading>もん</reading>				ぶん, もん									The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>writing</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>writing</kanji> as well.	Make sure you know those radicals, yo!	This kanji has more than one important reading you need to learn, sorry! But don't worry, here's a mnemonic to help you:  When you're <kanji>writing</kanji> you need things to fuel you. That's why you always eat <reading>bun</reading>s (<ja>ぶん</ja>) while you write. Bread bun, hot crossed buns, whatever as long as they're buns, they're great writing fuel.  When buns aren't enough, you call in the <reading>mon</reading>ster (<ja>もん</ja>) that lives under your bed. It pretends to chase you, motivating your writing even further, because if you don't write fast, you'll die by monster bites.	Imagine shoveling buns into your mouth and running from a monster as you're writing. You're so determined! This is going to be the best thing you've ever written!		136	-	kanji Lesson_2
日	Kanji	日	Sun	radical	Sun, Day	Sun, Day		<reading>にち</reading> <reading>じつ</reading>	ひ か び			にち, じつ	ひ, か, び								The <radical>sun</radical> radical and <kanji>sun</kanji> kanji are the same, huzzah! Also, if you want to remember <kanji>day</kanji> as well, you can just think about how a day is the time it takes for the sun to cross the sky.	The radical for this one is easy too, making the meaning for this kanji super easy as well!	There are so many on'yomi for this kanji, but since this kanji is so important and common, you'll end up learning them all eventually whether you want to or not. For now, you're only going to have to learn one of the readings, and that one is <ja>にち</ja>.   The <kanji>sun</kanji> is so hot. It focused its rays to take out one man... and that man is Friedrich <reading>Nietzsche</reading> (<ja>にち</ja>), famous philosopher. He philosophized one too many things about the sun, so the sun decided it was time he paid.	"This reading will be easier to remember if you know of Friedrich Nietzsche... so do your research and learn about him if you don't. He's a pretty historical dude. Imagine the sun totally pissed off, too. It makes a grunting noise as it builds up a sun beam to blast him off the face of the earth.  Also note that there's another reading worth learning as well: <ja>じつ</ja>. The reading can be remembered by thinking ""<reading>Gee! Two</reading> readings?"" Because, seriously, two readings? Too many..."		137	-	kanji Lesson_2
月	Kanji	月	Moon	radical	Moon, Month	Moon, Month		<reading>げつ</reading> <reading>がつ</reading>	つき			げつ, がつ	つき								The <kanji>moon</kanji> kanji is made up of the <radical>moon</radical> radical.	This should be EZPZ as long as you know the radicals already!	Since <ja>げつ</ja> and <ja>がつ</ja> are quite similar, we'll use one mnemonic to cover both of them. I expect your experience learning Japanese throughout the future will help you to memorize and differentiate between the two. When the moon goes down and goes away, everyone in the world <reading>gets</reading> (<ja>げつ</ja>) up, because that means it's going to be daytime soon!	This one might not be as memorable at first, but if you think of the moon, and think about what people do when the moon is up, you'll come to sleeping. Then naturally you can think about what happens when the moon goes down... people <reading>gets</reading> up!		138	-	kanji Lesson_2
木	Kanji	木	Tree	radical	Tree, Wood	Tree, Wood		<reading>もく</reading> <reading>ぼく</reading>	き こ			もく, ぼく	き, こ								This is another kanji that is the same as the radical. Both <radical>tree</radical> and <kanji>tree</kanji> are the same in looks and meaning.	So, how are those radicals doing? Do you know them well?	You’re walking through the trees, looking at them. They look ominous. Suddenly, you trip and fall. The trees start to <reading>mock</reading> you. Even the mocking birds mock you. It’s terrible. It’s painful. You’re being mocked as you pull yourself up off the ground.	Feel the shame, feel the irritation. Make yourself want to run away from those dumb trees that are mocking you.		139	-	kanji Lesson_2
水	Kanji	水	Water	radical	Water	Water		<reading>すい</reading>	みず			すい	みず								The <radical>water</radical> radical and the <kanji>water</kanji> kanji are the same.	So as long as you know the radicals, you know the kanji.	Imagine a lake (i.e. a whole bunch of <kanji>water</kanji>). When you think of water, you should try to think of this beautiful lake. It’s sunny, the trees smell nice (imagine a tree smell if you can – the more senses you use the better!) and on that tree there is an awesome tire <reading>swi</reading>ng (<ja>すい</ja>). You get onto the tire swing and you are swinging back and forth. The water is right in front of you, and you are able to use the swing to throw yourself into the water. It’s a lot colder than you expected, and you come back to the surface, gasping for breath. The water gets into your mouth and you taste it. How strange, it’s very, very <reading>swee</reading>t. Imagine the sweetness of the water and how weird it is (really really sweet, this water is).	I know that was a long one, but try to imagine all the different bits. Try to feel the feelings (cold, smell, etc) too. The more you create in this fake memory (which you’re using to remember and associate water with <ja>すい</ja> (swing)) the more likely you are to end up remembering enough to make it happen. Especially when it comes to the senses part, the more vividly you imagined it, the more likely you are to remember the on’yomi.		140	-	kanji Lesson_2
火	Kanji	火	Fire	radical	Fire	Fire		<reading>か</reading>	ひ ほ			か	ひ, ほ								The <radical>fire</radical> radical and the <kanji>fire</kanji> kanji are the same as each other.	If you know the radicals then this one is EZPZ.	Whenever we need to remember <ja>か</ja>, we use the word <reading>car</reading>.  For this kanji, when we think <kanji>fire</kanji>, we ought to think of something on fire. What's on fire? It's obviously your very own <reading>car</reading> (<ja>か</ja>)! Oh Goddd NOOO!	Oh no... Oh no!! If you don't have a <reading>car</reading>, imagine what it'd feel like if your car just exploded and burned down. If you do have a car, imagine your own car in this situation. It should be a terrible feeling, if you imagine it well enough. So, when you think <kanji>fire</kanji>, remember the fear you had when your car was given to the flames. Now you have to walk everywhere, sad :(		141	-	kanji Lesson_2
犬	Kanji	犬	Dog	radical	Dog	Dog		けん	<reading>いぬ</reading>			いぬ	けん								The <radical>dog</radical> radical and <kanji>dog</kanji> kanji are exactly the same!	Soon there will be very few kanji/radical-same combos ... so enjoy it while you can.	You see an emu running towards you from off in the distance (strange to see an emu in these parts...). As it gets closer, you realize that it's not an emu at all, it's something that sounds the same, or similar... an <reading>inu</reading>!	There's a good chance you know the word for dog in Japanese already too. If so, you're ahead of the game. If not, do your best to learn the reading before moving on.		142	-	kanji Lesson_2
王	Kanji	王	King	radical	King	King		<reading>おう</reading>				おう									The <radical>king</radical> radical and the <kanji>king</kanji> kanji are the same!	Hopefully you're a <kanji>king</kanji> of radicals... because if you are, this kanji was super easy for you!	"When you see the <kanji>king</kanji> you need to say, ""<reading>Oh</reading> (<ja>おう</ja>) King! Oh King, oh no, oh why are you looking at me like that? Oh King... you aren't going to chop off my head are you? OH NO!"""	"You need to be polite when you talk to the king and add ""Oh"" to the beginning, otherwise the king will be pretty angry and bad things might happen.  We're going to use the <ja>王</ja> kanji for all <ja>おう</ja> mnemonics from now on. So make sure you always remember to say <ja>おう</ja> King!"		143	-	kanji Lesson_2
出	Kanji	山	Mountain	radical	Exit	Exit		<reading>しゅつ</reading>	で だ			しゅつ	で, だ								There are two <radical>mountains</radical> in front of you... and probably a bunch more around you too. You are in a pass, and don't know how to get out. You are frantically looking for the <kanji>exit</kanji> before you freeze to death. The most important thing is to find the exit from this mountain range - your life depends on it.	"In your imagination, really feel like your life depends on getting out. The important part is the feeling of ""needing to get out of the mountain pass."" If you have this feeling, you'll be more likely to remember that this kanji means exit, because that's what you want to do when you see this kanji."	As you're trying to <kanji>exit</kanji> this mountain range, you suddenly realize that someone is actually hunting you. What? Make sure to feel that sudden realization. It's crazy. Then, you find the exit and run towards it. Sadly, the hunter is waiting there, and he <reading>shoots you</reading> (<ja>しゅつ</ja>) through the leg, knocking you down.	Focus on the surprise of realizing you're being hunted while trying to find the exit to the mountain range, then focus on the next part, where you get shot. View it in your head as the hunter shooting you. Powww!		144	-	kanji Lesson_2
右	Kanji	ナ, 口	Narwhal, Mouth	radical, radical	Right	Right		<reading>ゆう</reading> <reading>う</reading>	みぎ			ゆう, う	みぎ								<radical>Narwhal</radical> <radical>mouth</radical>s are on the <kanji>right</kanji> side of their head. In fact, some people didn't think they had mouths at all because they weren't looking from the right. Rookie mistake.	Imagine looking at a narwhal from the front. No mouth. Now look at it from the right. Mouth!	How did we know to look from the <kanji>right</kanji>, though? Because of the <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>). Youths think in ways that older people usually don't. That's why they can see the swirls on cereal, hear the music behind noise, and of course, look at things from the right side.	"Imagine a bunch of youths walking in a group and looking at everything from the right. You remember when you were a youth and you used to look at everything from one side too.  Note: All the <ja>ゆう</ja> readings will use the word ""youths"" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these ""youths"" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world, just like how people treat Millennials nowadays."		145	-	kanji Lesson_2
四	Kanji	口, 儿	Mouth, Legs	radical, radical	Four	Four, 4		<reading>し</reading>	よん よ			し	よん, よ								Imagine contorting yourself in such a way that your <radical>legs</radical> end up inside your <radical>mouth</radical>. You have bent your body in all the wrong ways in order to achieve this. In fact, if you look at yourself, you look like a square now... You're just a person with <kanji>four</kanji> sides.	If you can get to square, you should be able to get to four as well, since squares always have four sides.	This amazing feat, which turned you into a <kanji>four</kanji> sided square, has you looking like a four sided animal: the <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>). Look at yourself in the mirror and see an adorable four-sided sheep looking back at you. (You can't see the other sides because mirrors aren't 3D and whatnot. So you're a bit cartoonish.)	What's better than one four sided sheep?		146	-	kanji Lesson_2
左	Kanji	ナ, 工	Narwhal, Construction	radical, radical	Left	Left		<reading>さ</reading>	ひだり			さ	ひだり								<radical>Narwhal</radical>s do <radical>construction</radical> with their left hands (or flippers, I guess). That's because all narwhals are left-handed!	Picture a bunch of narwhals constructing an underwater ice village. They're all working away with their left hands.	In their <kanji>left</kanji> hands, the narwhals all hold <reading>saw</reading>s (<ja>さ</ja>). That's because the ice for their homes is already there, so they just need to saw away at them to make the shapes they want. Narwhal construction is actually very simple.	If you're right-handed, imagine trying to use these left-handed saws. It flips and flops all over until you drop it. But if you're left-handed it feels just right!		147	-	kanji Lesson_2
本	Kanji	本	Book	radical	Book, Origin, Real, Main	Book, Origin, Real, Main		<reading>ほん</reading>	もと			ほん	もと								The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>book</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>book</kanji> as well.  Take note that the second, third, and fourth meanings of this kanji are <kanji>origin</kanji>, <kanji>real</kanji>, and <kanji>main</kanji>. You can figure this out by thinking about how books mainly have their origins in real life.	Make sure you know those radicals, yo! And good luck with all the meanings (sorry sorry sorry).	<kanji>Book</kanji>s are one of the best ways to <reading>hone</reading> (<ja>ほん</ja>) your intellect, you know?	Just think about books and how you use them to hone your skills. Or read a book about honing things. Like swords.		148	-	kanji Lesson_2
正	Kanji	一, 止	Ground, Stop	radical, radical	Correct	Correct		<reading>せい</reading> <reading>しょう</reading>	ただ まさ			せい, しょう	ただ, まさ								There is a line on the <radical>ground</radical> so you <radical>stop</radical> and a giant sign pops up that says <kanji>CORRECT</kanji>! You obeyed the rules of the road and did the correct thing.	"Imagine walking, staring at the ground until you come across a line that you're supposed to stop at. If you stop, the big ""correct"" sign appears, chiming a happy tune."	You did the <kanji>correct</kanji> thing, so the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) shows up to reward you! He holds out a shiny new <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) in his hand, gently taps it onto each of your shoulders, and then hands it to you. It's big, curved and you love it.	Being correct got the Shougun to notice you AND a new saber. You better make sure to answer this kanji correctly in your reviews too, so you can keep being correct and have more nice things happen.		149	-	kanji Lesson_2
玉	Kanji	王, 丶	King, Drop	radical, radical	Ball	Ball		ぎょく	<reading>たま</reading>			たま	ぎょく								The <radical>king</radical> has something in his hand that he's <radical>drop</radical>ping... but it bounces too! He's bouncing a <kanji>ball</kanji>	This kanji looks just like a king bouncing a <kanji>ball</kanji>, no? If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the <kanji>ball</kanji>) over and over again, then laying some hoops like a pro.	Think of someone curled up in a ball. It is someone you know / someone famous named “Tom” (<ja>たま</ja>).	"So, who's in a ball? Which ""Tom"" did you choose?"		150	-	kanji Lesson_2
田	Kanji	田	Rice Paddy	radical	Rice Paddy, Rice Field, Field	Rice Paddy, Rice Field, Field		でん	<reading>た</reading>			た	でん								The <radical>rice paddy</radical> radical and the <kanji>rice paddy</kanji> kanji are the same, making this one super easy to remember, at least meaning-wise.	Just know your radicals, and you will know your kanji as well.	"To remember the reading <ja>た</ja>, we use the word ""taco.""  You're in the rice field... but when you lean down to examine the rice more closely, you see that it's not rice that's growing, it's a bunch of little <reading>ta</reading>cos (<ja>た</ja>), blossoming out of the ground."	Smell the tacos. Touch the tacos. Taste the tacos. This is definitely a very strange rice field.		151	-	kanji Lesson_2
白	Kanji	白	White	radical	White	White		<reading>はく</reading>	しろ しら			はく	しろ, しら								The radical <radical>white</radical> and the kanji <kanji>white</kanji> are the same.	Study your radicals hard! Most important thing!	The <kanji>white</kanji> team was the first to be able to <reading>hack</reading> (<ja>はく</ja>) the <kanji>white</kanji> iPhone.	Imagine two teams (black and <kanji>white</kanji>), wearing their team colors, working really hard on hacking the iPhone. It is a huge contest, and people are watching with a lot of tension, to see who will hack the <kanji>white</kanji> iPhone first. Feel that tension, and see the colors separating them so vividly. The colors are important, and the excitement of the winner holding up the <reading>hack</reading>ed iPhone is too.		152	-	kanji Lesson_2
目	Kanji	目	Eye	radical	Eye	Eye		もく	<reading>め</reading>			め	もく								The <radical>eye</radical> radical and <kanji>eye</kanji> kanji are the same as each other, so now you know them both.	Well... you'll know them both as long as you studied your radicals, young grasshopper. If you didn't, then you're just a young grasshopper who needs to study their radicals.	"Your <kanji>eyes</kanji> are important to you, right? Sadly, one of your eyes is missing right now, because a sheep grabbed it and pulled it out, and is now running away from you, yelling his sheep call.... ""<reading>Mehhhhhh</reading> (<ja>め</ja>)!"""	"Of course, feel the pain of your eye being gone... and struggle to get it back. You eventually give up because the sheep is too fast, but then you come up with an idea. What if I call out back to the sheep in its own language? Go ahead and cover one eye and start making ""MEHHH"" noises to see if you can get the sheep to come back to you and give you your eye. It's up to you whether it works or not, but be sure to feel frustrated by its reaction, or happy by it. Either one works."		153	-	kanji Lesson_2
立	Kanji	立	Stand	radical	Stand	Stand		<reading>りつ</reading> <reading>りゅう</reading>	た			りつ, りゅう	た								The radical <radical>stand</radical> and the kanji <kanji>stand</kanji> are the same thing, so now you know them both.	If you're keeping up with your radical studies, you're also keeping up with your kanji studies!	Think of someone who has to <kanji>stand</kanji> up straight for you. These people are pros in hospitality. These are the doormen at the <reading>Ritz</reading> (<ja>りつ</ja>).	Imagine the doormen being extra straight… too straight in their standing. On their uniform is “The Ritz” written in fine lettering, and as you walk past them, they stand up straight and say “Welcome to the Ritz!” Whatever you do, while you’re thinking about it, make sure you think about how they stand up so straight, and associate it with these doormen, who work, specifically, at the Ritz. If you effectively imagine all this, you should be able to remember this on’yomi. Go through it like it’s a movie in your head!		154	-	kanji Lesson_2
々	Kanji	勹, 丶	Prison, Drop	radical, radical	Repeater, Repetition, Reduplication, Iteration Mark	Repeater, Repetition, Reduplication, Iteration Mark			<reading>のま</reading>			のま									This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: <ja>人々</ja> is actually <ja>人人</ja>. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the <kanji>repeater</kanji>. It repeats what comes before it.  To remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a <radical>drop</radical> of water dripping into a <radical>prison</radical>. Drip drop drip drop. It does that over and over again, driving the prisoners nuts. But it never stops. It just repeats over and over.	Since this kanji doesn't really have a meaning as much as it does a function, try to change the way you think about it when you're memorizing it.	"In Japanese, this symbol is often called the <ja>のま</ja> because it looks like the katakana characters <ja>ノ</ja> and <ja>マ</ja> put together. If you know katakana then this will be easy to read. If you don't, think of it this way:   Your mom is the <kanji>repeater</kanji>. She is trying to force feed you over and over again until you explode (literally). You keep yelling ""<reading>No ma</reading>!"" (<ja>のま</ja>) but she doesn't stop. She's on a repeating track, never stopping, repeating forever."	If you feel like you're so full you're about to burst, and if you imagine your mom doing this to you (how could you, ma?), you should be able to remember the reading of this kanji. That being said, the reading is mostly only useful in the event that you have to identify a <ja>々</ja>—otherwise, you won't see it much.		155	-	kanji Lesson_2
