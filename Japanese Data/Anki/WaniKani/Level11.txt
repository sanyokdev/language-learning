令	Radical				Orders	Orders															"The ""Hat-Ground"" stamp is on this envelope. That can only mean one thing: <radical>Orders</radical> from HQ. Imagine this stamp on some orders for you—read the orders out loud to help yourself remember that this hat-ground stamp means ""orders"" and nothing else."					1608	-	Lesson_11 radical
申	Radical				Humble	Humble, Say Humbly															This radical is the same as the kanji you learned earlier, but the meaning is a little different.

兄	Radical				Older Brother	Older Brother, Big Brother															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>older brother</radical>.					1610	-	Lesson_11 radical
及	Radical				Escalator	Escalator															Do you remember stairs (<ja>乃</ja>)? This radical is a lot like that, but it has extra bits and pieces. It's still stairs... but it's more complicated. And faster! That's why it's an <radical>escalator</radical> instead!					1611	-	Lesson_11 radical
戈	Radical				Drunkard	Drunkard															This is a ceremony radical with a slide radical. Why would someone be sliding on the floor at a ceremony? If they're a <radical>drunkard</radical>, that's why! People love to drink at ceremonies. And there's always at least one drunkard who takes it too far and slides across the floor doing the worm.					1612	-	Lesson_11 radical
皮	Radical				Skin	Skin															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>skin</radical>.					1613	-	Lesson_11 radical
艮	Radical				Root	Root, Good															If the sun is out and you kick the ground, you'll hit a <radical>root</radical>. Roots try to come up when the sun is bright. But if you kick too hard, the root will trip you, so watch out!					1614	-	Lesson_11 radical

単	Radical				Simple	Simple, Witch Doctor															There's some stuff growing out of this rice paddy and there is a cross guarding over it. This rice paddy is owned by a <radical>simple</radical> family that lives the simple life. They grow their rice, pray to their god, and everything is nice and simple. Ahh, I'm jealous.					1617	-	Lesson_11 radical
<i class=radical-blackjack></i>	Radical				Blackjack	Blackjack															You have the radical twenty and the kanji one. Put those together and you get 21. What's another name for 21? That's <radical>blackjack</radical>.					1618	-	Lesson_11 radical
<i class=radical-trash></i>	Radical				Trash	Trash, Boob															There's a lid on top of something you're trying to keep private. It's your <radical>trash</radical>. You wouldn't want people going through your private trash, which is why we put lids on our trash cans. It's also illegal to look through someone's trash, so make sure you never do that.					1619	-	Lesson_11 radical
<i class=radical-bear></i>	Radical				Bear	Bear															"This looks like the letter ""B"" which stands for <radical>bear</radical>. B for Bear! The letter B also looks a bit like a bear, if you think about it."					1620	-	Lesson_11 radical
争	Kanji	勹, ヨ, 亅	Prison, Wolverine, Barb	radical, radical, radical	Conflict	Conflict		<reading>そう</reading>	あらそ			そう	あらそ								If you keep a <radical>wolverine</radical> in a <radical>prison</radical> with <radical>barb</radical>s, you’re likely to get into a <kanji>conflict</kanji> with animal rights groups. Wolverines aren’t meant to be kept in cages, let alone barbed prisons. There’s going to be some sort of conflict here, and animal activist groups are not going to be happy with you.	Imagine you’re the wolverine in this barbed prison. There’s hardly enough room for you to even turn around in here. The barbs keep poking you as well. Have you ever run into a barbed wire fence? It’s not pleasant.	When the wolverine cuts itself inside the barbed prison (which is inevitable), the conflict changes. Now there is a <kanji>conflict</kanji> between the wolverine and its <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Does it lose it and become a shell of its former self? Or does it keep fighting and try to hang onto what's left of its soul?	Pretend you're the wolverine once again. You're already in pain from gouging yourself in this barbed prison. But now you can feel a conflict within yourself. Your soul can't take this. You have to hold on, but it's so hard to keep fighting.		1621	-	kanji Lesson_11
仲	Kanji	ｲ, 中	Leader, Middle	radical, radical	Relationship	Relationship		ちゅう	<reading>なか</reading>			なか	ちゅう								A <radical>middle</radical> of the road <radical>leader</radical> is likely to have an average <kanji>relationship</kanji> with everyone. He doesn’t really take sides in matters, and just stays in the middle. This makes him seem like sort of a wishy washy people pleaser, and as such his relationships with people are rarely anything more than average.	I’m sure you’ve heard of “flip-floppers” in politics, or people who try and take both sides of an issue, always staying in the middle ground and never really taking a stand. Imagine one of these people to represent this kanji.	This kanji is pronounced exactly like the kanji <ja>中</ja> (<ja>なか</ja>). It's one of those kanji where you can figure out the reading from one of the radicals.	Imagine your favorite flip-flopper from before. Now imagine that there’s a knocker on his forehead and you get to knock that knocker as hard as you like. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Imagine yourself doing this.		1622	-	kanji Lesson_11
伝	Kanji	ｲ, 云	Leader, Cloud	radical, radical	Transmit, Tell	Transmit, Tell		<reading>でん</reading>	つた つて			でん	つた, つて								The <radical>leader</radical> has a <radical>cloud</radical> that he uses to <kanji>transmit</kanji> all of the messages he needs to send to his people. The cloud floats above him and when he wants to tell people something he just whispers into the cloud and it transmits his message really, really loudly to all of them.	Picture this special cloud floating above your leader. It's probably just a speaker attached to a drone covered in cotton balls.	As the leader <kanji>transmit</kanji>s his latest series of messages to you and the others, you notice a pretty large <reading>den</reading>t (<ja>でん</ja>) in it. That dent is probably a clue to what this cloud is really made of.	You highly doubt this is a magical cloud that can transmit messages. You inch closer to the big dent and try to poke it. Your finger goes right in! Hmm, you're still pretty sure there's a trick to this thing.		1623	-	kanji Lesson_11
共	Kanji	<i class=radical-blackjack></i>, ハ	Blackjack, Fins	radical, radical	Together	Together		<reading>きょう</reading>	とも			きょう	とも								The card game fish are best at is <radical>blackjack</radical> because they can easily hold the cards with their <radical>fins</radical> <kanji>together</kanji>. In blackjack you don't have to have a huge hand, full of cards. It's just a few, so fish fins can keep them together and just hit or stay.	Imagine a fish trying to hold a full hand of cards together. Impossible! Fish don’t have fingers to keep them spread properly. Now imagine a fish trying to hold two cards together and nodding to hit. It's much easier to keep things together this way!	Once a year trillions of fish get <kanji>together</kanji> in <reading><ja>きょう</ja></reading><ja>と</ja> to play blackjack. They have a huge tournament there once a year.	Imagine a bunch of fish gathering together in <ja>きょうと</ja> to participate in this blackjack tournament. With so many fish all together in one place, it probably smells pretty fishy.		1624	-	kanji Lesson_11
好	Kanji	女, 子	Woman, Child	radical, radical	Like	Like		<reading>こう</reading>	す この			こう	す, この								There is a <radical>woman</radical> and a <radical>child</radical> in front of you. You <kanji>like</kanji> them very much.	Imagine a woman and a child you like very much. Just appreciate them, and think about how much you like those two. The reading mnemonic definitely won't ruin your image of them or anything.	"""I <kanji>like</kanji> you two,"" you say to the woman and child. They both turn their heads 180 degrees back towards you. They both have faces that look just like <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>'s. ""We like you too,"" they say in unison."	And you DO like them. You have always been a fan of <ja>こういち</ja>'s kanji learning methods, and you feel so lucky to have married a woman who looks just like <ja>こういち</ja> and then (this is the real miracle!) gave birth to a child that looks like <ja>こういち</ja> too. Hashtag blessed.		1625	-	kanji Lesson_11
成	Kanji	戈, 刀	Drunkard, Sword	radical, radical	Become	Become		<reading>せい</reading>	な			せい	な								When a <radical>drunkard</radical> holds a <radical>sword</radical> it <kanji>becomes</kanji> something else. The drunkard doesn't become a swordsman, they're still just a drunkard. But the sword in their hands does.	Picture the drunkard standing in front of you. He picked up the sword and is holding it above his head. It's becoming... becoming...	The sword has <kanji>become</kanji> a <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>)! It's just like the saber you have! Hey, wait.	If a sword becomes a saber in the hands of a drunkard... then what are you? Geez this became pretty deep.  You slice down the drunkard with your saber and become a little more depressed than you were before.		1626	-	kanji Lesson_11
老	Kanji	耂, 匕	Coffin, Spoon	radical, radical	Elderly	Elderly		<reading>ろう</reading>				ろう									By the time you finish digging a <radical>coffin</radical> hole with nothing but a <radical>spoon</radical>, you’ll be an old <kanji>elderly</kanji> person. Digging with nothing but a spoon takes a long time, especially when the hole needs to be big enough for a coffin. You might as well be digging it for yourself at this rate. By the time you finish, you’ll be all wrinkled and elderly and just about ready to keel over.	Imagine yourself digging a coffin hole with nothing but a spoon. Your hands get all cramped, your wrist starts to hurt, and you get painful blisters on your hands. It takes forever to dig a hole big enough for a coffin!	Now that you’re <kanji>elderly</kanji> (and probably about to die) you suddenly crave some delicious <reading>roe</reading> (<ja>ろう</ja>). Salmon roe, sea urchin roe, tofugu roe, doesn’t matter. Your old, tired bones need roe after all that hard work!	You hated roe when you were still young, but now that you’re an elderly old fart you really want to eat it. Roe is for old people, you guess, as you slurp it up.		1627	-	kanji Lesson_11
位	Kanji	ｲ, 立	Leader, Stand	radical, radical	Rank	Rank		<reading>い</reading>	くらい			い	くらい								A <radical>leader</radical> <radical>stand</radical>s at the highest <kanji>rank</kanji> in an organization. The leader is of the highest rank and stands above all others.	Picture this great leader. Imagine him actually standing on the shoulders of his supporters who are a lower rank than he is. He’s standing atop this great pyramid as a fearless leader.	This great leader is actually the leader of the boy scouts. And as we all know, the highest <kanji>rank</kanji> in boy scouts is the rank of <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) scout. This great leader has attained the rank of eagle scout and stands above all other scouts.	Picture the same ranking pyramid from before, only all the members are boy scouts, and the leader at the top is an eagle. Hear the piercing screech of the eagle with your ears.		1628	-	kanji Lesson_11
低	Kanji	ｲ, 氏, 一	Leader, Clan, Ground	radical, radical, radical	Low	Low		<reading>てい</reading>	ひく			てい	ひく								The <radical>leader</radical> of your <radical>clan</radical> wants to live close to the <radical>ground</radical> so he demands you get <kanji>low</kanji>. Low, low, with your belly to the ground. That way you're always below him, since he's the leader.	"Picture yourself, face smooshed into the ground, and you can hear the leader shouting above you, ""GET LOW!"""	<kanji>Low</kanji> people like you can only eat low food like potatoes. But that's boring, so you low people learned to make <reading>ta</reading>ter (<ja>てい</ja>) tots. You roll them to each other and eat them without lifting your heads.	Get low to the ground right now and ask your mom or dad to roll some tater tots towards your face. Eat them up, mm mm.		1629	-	kanji Lesson_11
初	Kanji	ネ, 刀	Spirit, Sword	radical, radical	First	First		<reading>しょ</reading>	はじ はつ そ ぞ			しょ	はじ, はつ, そ, ぞ								If you want a <radical>spirit</radical> <radical>sword</radical>, you have to be the <kanji>first</kanji> one to find it. Do you really think the first person to come across a spirit sword wouldn't want it?! No. So if you're any place but first, you're not getting anything.	Imagine it like commenting on Youtube or Facebook. If you can say FIRST, first, well congrats. You win the internet spirit sword.	If you were lucky enough to be the <kanji>first</kanji> one to find the spirit sword, you should open up a small <reading>show</reading> (<ja>しょ</ja>) to show it off! And then you can make yourself the first in line every day to see the show.	This is the first show of this type, anywhere in the world!		1630	-	kanji Lesson_11

Now that you have them in there, you have to make them <kanji>separate</kanji> from each other.	Anyone can put a sword and knife in their mouth. But not everyone can make them separate while still in your mouth.	Why are you trying to make a sword and knife <kanji>separate</kanji> in your mouth? Because someone <reading>bets you</reading> (<ja>べつ</ja>) can't do it.	"""I bet you can't separate the sword and knife,"" they say in an annoying voice. Alright, time for you to show them. Nobody bets you anything without you blindly trying to do it!"		1631	-	kanji Lesson_11
利	Kanji	禾, 刂	Grain, Knife	radical, radical	Profit, Benefit, Advantage	Profit, Benefit, Advantage		<reading>り</reading>	き			り	き								Cut <radical>grain</radical>s with a <radical>knife</radical> to make them smaller and you'll make a great <kanji>profit</kanji>. By cutting them, now you can get three grains worth of money for what was once a single grain. 	Imagine buying some rice. Now cut all the grains with a knife into smaller grains. Now sell them for two, three, four times the profit!	"To make an even better <kanji>profit</kanji>, you decide to cut up <reading>ree</reading>ds (<ja>り</ja>) too. You stuff the grains in the reeds and sell that as ""self-cooking"" sets."	Picture all of your reeds full of grains in a row. The entire world will benefit from your crafty invention. And you'll turn a great profit too, which certainly doesn't hurt.		1632	-	kanji Lesson_11

They are toiling away preparing a feast for this woman of power while she kicks back on her cozy stool. She’s a queen and deserves to be pampered.	Imagine you are in a position of power and can relax on a stool while your minions toil away in the kitchen to prepare you a feast. It’s good to have money! You’ve got it made. Imagine how smug you feel.  Note - there are a few other kanji that have a similar meaning to this one. This kanji is used in words that refer to doing work, with a focus on making a concerted effort.	The servants are making lots of food for you and your <reading>do</reading>g (<ja>ど</ja>). You're really hungry, so you encourage your minions to <kanji>toil</kanji> away faster so that you might feast a bit sooner.	Imagine eating all this food with your dog.

Labor is for the weak! A Viking of power takes what he wants, and need not labor for it. A powerful Viking plunders all and takes what he wants!	Imagine yourself as a powerful Viking. You have the power to take anything you want, pillaging and plundering to your heart’s content. Imagine all the things you would acquire with this sort of power.  Note - there are a few other kanji that have a similar meaning to this one. This kanji is used in words related to physical, or manual labor, with an emphasis on how darn tiring it is!	It takes a lot of <kanji>labor</kanji> to harvest <reading>roe</reading> (<ja>ろう</ja>) so that’s what the Viking decides to take first! Roe is delicious, but it’s small and delicate. Vikings don’t labor for their own roe! They take it and eat it!	Picture this powerful Viking laying siege on a small fishing village and taking all the roe and stuffing it into his bearded face. So much labor went into harvesting that roe! Vikings are so mean!		1634	-	kanji Lesson_11

You are a commanding officer and orders from your mouth are law. Your orders alone determine the ultimate fate of your soldiers.	Pretend you are a high ranking officer and imagine yourself giving orders to your underlings. Imagine all the power and influence you have. It feels good.	You are the commanding officer on the <reading>May</reading>flower (<ja>めい</ja>). You give orders to colonize America. The orders spewing from your mouth hole determine the <kanji>fate</kanji> of the settlers and the fate of America and the fate of the world! You and the Mayflower have changed everything forever.	Students of American history are very familiar with the Mayflower. Recall learning about it in school whenever you see this kanji. Or look it up on Wikipedia if you don’t know about it.

The shore goes as far as your eyes can see.	Sitting up there, watching the <kanji>coast</kanji> with you, is <reading>Gan</reading>dhi (<ja>がん</ja>). The world famous Gandhi, is just hanging out up here with you, looking down at what you now realize must be a coast in India.	Sit down next to Gandhi and close your eyes.

This is the longest game of blackjack you’ve ever played and it feels like ages since you started. You’ve been sitting out in the sun playing blackjack since long, long ago.	Imagine yourself playing a never-ending game of blackjack out in the hot sun. You’re sticky, sweaty, and tired. But all you can do is continue to play your game of blackjack. It’s miserable.	Once you finally finish the game, you walk the long walk back home, in the sun, barefoot, on a dirt road that hasn’t been maintained since <kanji>long ago</kanji>. Your feet are all sweaty from being out in the sun, and walking on this dirt road gives you <reading>muck ashi</reading> (<ja>むかし</ja>). Your ashi (feet) are all mucky and muddy from the combination of dirt and sweat. Your muck ashi are really gross, man.

All of the people who come and worship here have a special place in their hearts for the cow.	This cow is <kanji>special</kanji> because it belonged to <reading>Toku</reading>gawa (<ja>とく</ja>) Ieyasu, Japan's first shougun and uniter of Japan! He's a super important figure in Japanese history. You should absolutely look him up and read a bit about him (when you're caught up on these lessons, that is).

He is searching for <radical>treasure</radical>. It is said that this treasure here in this rice field will make things much easier for the leader (that's what leaders really want, after all). If he gets this treasure, it will be a great <kanji>convenience</kanji> for him, because convenience is everything when you're the leader.	"Imagine the leader looking around the rice paddy. He keeps saying, ""Ugh, it would be convenient if I didn't have to walk around out here looking for the treasure that's going to make things more convenient for me. Ugh."" Go ahead and say this phrase out loud, too, pretending to be the leader in the rice paddy. Feel the cold and the wet, making it less convenient for you."	He finds a place to dig in the ground. It looks like there's some fresh dirt here. Finally, the treasure of <kanji>convenience</kanji> that will make this leader's life so much easier. He digs into the ground and pulls out a box. When he opens it, he finds out it's a <reading>ben</reading>to (<ja>べん</ja>). My god, he thinks. This really will make my life more convenient. My people can take their lunches with them now instead of coming back to base to eat, which will waste way less time!	Feel the happiness that the leader would feel at this revelation. It will make everything much more convenient for him, since he's not the one doing all the manual labor. He won't have to eat out of a bento, that's for sure.		1654	-	kanji Lesson_11

By power, I mean a lot of strength because this leader is very strong and moving heavy things is no problem for him. His power allows the leader to move heavy things with little to no work at all.	Picture this powerful leader, bare chested with a crown on his head. His muscles are bulging as he picks up heavy things and casually tosses them aside. How does he maintain so many muscles?  Note - there are a few other kanji that have a similar meaning to this one. This kanji is used in words that refer to doing work, with a focus on movement or physical operation of a device.	Where does this leader’s power come from? <reading>Dou</reading>ghnuts (<ja>どう</ja>). He eats nothing but doughnuts. He has a special crew of bakers that <kanji>work</kanji> for him in his castle and they work all day to make the leader doughnuts of power. They are imbued with many secret ingredients that give the leader the power to move anything, no matter how heavy it is.	Picture yourself eating one of these power doughnuts. It’s delicious. Doughnuts are fantastic. Taste the fresh doughnut in your mouth as it crumbles and melts on your tongue. It’s the best doughnut you’ve ever had.		1655	-	kanji Lesson_11

Here's an order: study your radicals.	Your <kanji>orders</kanji> are to get a <reading>ray</reading> (<ja>れい</ja>) gun.	Imagine an authority figure giving you this order as an official order. Ray guns don't really exist, so you think it's a pretty strange order.  Hint: when you see the <radical>orders</radical> radical, the reading will often be <ja>れい</ja>. The mnemonic will likely involve orders to get a ray gun of some kind.		1656	-	kanji Lesson_11
意	Kanji	音, 心	Sound, Heart	radical, radical	Idea	Idea		<reading>い</reading>				い									"The <radical>sound</radical> of your <radical>heart</radical> gives me an <kanji>idea</kanji>. The methodic thump thump thumping of a heart puts me in a trance that gives me great ideas. It’s a very inspirational sound, the sound of a heart is. It gives me an idea.   Alternatively, you could look at this kanji and see a ""stand"" radical and something that kind of (almost) looks like the kanji for ""think."" When you stand up and think, you come up with your very own <kanji>idea</kanji>s!"	Put your hand over your heart, or on your wrist, or somewhere you can feel your pulse. Your heart is pumping blood through your body, hear the sound of your heart beat and try to picture and get an idea for how all the blood flows through your body.	The heart of an <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) is very strong. The person who knew this probably came up with the <kanji>idea</kanji> to make the bald eagle a symbol of the United States. Eagles are always flying around and doing things, so their hearts are very strong.	Picture the majestic animal that is the bald eagle. Imagine the sound of an eagle screeching as it zooms through the air, flapping its wings in the wind. It’s pretty impressive.		1657	-	kanji Lesson_11

It's <kanji>flavor</kanji>. It's what shoots your mouth off, which explains why it hurts so much when you eat something awesome.	Imagine how your favorite food tastes. Imagine a jet taking off in your mouth because of it.	And what has more <kanji>flavor</kanji> than a big slab of <reading>me</reading>at (<ja>み</ja>)? You love meat and its flavor nearly as much as you love the flavor of its juice. So many good things to put in your mouth!
