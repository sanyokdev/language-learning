Using a <kanji>calendar</kanji>, you too can remember history (otherwise, who knows when these things happened).

- Hint: Make sure you make the connection between the word <jp>歴史</jp> and this kanji. If you do, it'll be much easier to remember the reading of this kanji."

- Hint: Imagine, if you will, a geoduck. Now imagine that same geoduck with a massive head. It looks ridiculous, and more disgusting than ever.

10	横	Side,Horizontal	Tree,Yellow	木,黄	"The <radical>tree</radical> marked with a <radical>yellow</radical> X on the <kanji>side</kanji> of the house is going to get cut down. You’ve marked it with a yellow X so the hired help knows which tree to cut down. There are a lot of trees on the side of the house, but the tree marked with a yellow X is the only one in danger of causing damage to your roof in the event of a storm.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture the scene of a woman with a chainsaw cutting down this tree marked with a yellow X. Hear the sound of the chainsaw buzzing and the grinding of wood as it meets the side of the trunk. It’s very loud. Woodchips go flying everywhere."	<jp>おう</jp>	<reading><jp>よこ</jp></reading>	None	よこ	"Wait, that woman with the chainsaw is <reading>Yoko</reading> (<jp>よこ</jp>) Ono! Yes, the same Yoko Ono who’s married to John Lennon of the Beatles. What’s she doing chopping down trees on the <kanji>side</kanji> of your house? Who can say. Silly Yoko.<br><br>

- Hint: Now picture the same scene as before only imagining Yoko Ono wielding that chainsaw. Maybe she’s dancing. Maybe there’s some Beatles music playing in the background. Either way it’s a strange sight – remember it."
10	線	Line	Thread,White,Water	糸,白,水	"If someone falls overboard while you're <radical>white</radical> <radical>water </radical>rafting, you can use a long piece of <radical>thread</radical> as a life <kanji>line</kanji>. Sure it might be thin, but a line of thread is better than nothing. Throw them a line and drag them back aboard! Those white water rapids are vicious.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine you're the person who fell overboard. The white water is rushing violently and it is deathly cold. Feel the water and freezing temperature on your skin. But look! Someone has thrown you a line of thread! You're saved!"	<reading><jp>せん</jp></reading>	None	None	せん	"The person who threw you that <kanji>line</kanji> of thread is actually a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<jp>せん</jp>). How kind of him. After you are safe you hop on the centaur's back and ride around to get the wind to dry you off.<br><br>

- Hint: Coming out of the rushing water, this centaur is like an angel sent from heaven. He's just saved your life. Imagine the happiness and gratitude you feel towards this centaur as you are pulled to safety by that line of thread."
10	読	Read	Say,Sell	言,売	"You have to <radical>say</radical> what you’re <radical>sell</radical>ing because people don’t like to <kanji>read</kanji>. If they walk right by and don’t read, you better say what you have for sale so they’ll know! Read it out loud to them.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine reading what you have for sale out loud to people walking by because they’re too lazy to read it for themselves."	<jp>とう, どく</jp>	<reading><jp>よ</jp></reading>	None	よ	"What are you forced to <kanji>read</kanji> aloud to sell? <reading>Yo-</reading>yo (<jp>よ</jp>) instructions! You’d think they’d be self explanatory, but there are actually a lot of rules and tricks that you have to read to get good at yo-yoing. Read all of these out loud so you can sell them.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine reading through your list of yo-yo tricks. Do you know how to pronounce those weird yo-yo names?"
10	農	Farming,Agriculture	Music,Landslide	曲,辰	"You blast your <radical>music</radical> loud so it causes a <radical>landslide</radical>, revealing the perfect soil for <kanji>farming</kanji>! Musically moved dirt is perfect for <kanji>agriculture</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine slowly turning up your big boombox until your ears hurt and the ground beneath your feet is vibrating with the beat. Soon you and the boombox are sliding with all of the earth down the hill and onto your farmland. Hooray, now the farming can begin!"	<reading><jp>のう</jp></reading>	None	None	のう	"The first person to come up with this <kanji>farming</kanji> method was <reading>No</reading>stradamus (<jp>のう</jp>), the famous seer and prophecy man. He predicted humans of the future would use special ""yell cubes"" to ""move that good earth.""<br><br>

- Hint: Picture Nostradamus flailing his arms and trying to explain his vision to the farmers at the time. He knows that if they listen their farming techniques will improve, but they're looking at him like he's nuts."
10	速	Fast	Scooter,Bundle	"<i class=""radical-scooter""></i>,束"	"You jump on your <radical>scooter</radical> with a big <radical>bundle</radical> to go as <kanji>fast</kanji> as you can! You have a bundle of pizzas in here, and they need to be delivered as fast as you can get them there!<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine how fast you can go on your scooter holding this bundle. It's way faster than trying to go on foot, that's for sure!"	<reading><jp>そく</jp></reading>	<jp>はや</jp>	None	そく	"You were going so <kanji>fast</kanji>, you only put on <reading>sock</reading>s (<jp>そく</jp>). So now you're barreling down the street at top speeds in just your sad, white socks.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine riding the scooter as fast as you can in just your socks. You can feel the wind pulling them off your feet!"
9	勝	Win,Victory	Moon,Gladiator,Power	"月,<i class=""radical-gladiator""></i>,力"	"The <radical>moon</radical> grants a <radical>gladiator</radical> its <radical>power</radical> so he will <kanji>win</kanji>! <kanji>Victory</kanji> will be his!<br><br>

- Hint: Watch as the moon's power fills the gladiator. He starts to glow, grows larger, and has some craters on his face now. Well.. okay."	<reading><jp>しょう</jp></reading>	<jp>か</jp>	None	しょう	"He <kanji>win</kanji>s over and over again, and soon the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<jp>しょう</jp>) is even rooting for him. In fact, the Shougun claims him as his personal gladiator of choice.<br><br>

- Hint: The Shougun is only interested in people who win. But you probably could have guessed that already."
9	物	Thing	Cow,Wing	牛,勿	"A <radical>wing</radical>ed <radical>cow</radical> is flying in the air. What a strange <kanji>thing</kanji>! You’ve heard of flying pigs before, but cows? This is a new and strange thing indeed! Cows with wings! What a silly thing to imagine.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine if cows could fly. Wouldn’t you be jealous of them? I mean, if a cow can fly, any old thing should be able to, right?"	<reading><jp>ぶつ, もつ</jp></reading>	<jp>もの</jp>	None	ぶつ, もつ	"You want a <kanji>thing</kanji> to help you fly with the cow so you put on your flying <reading>boots</reading> (<jp>ぶつ</jp>). Your flying boots are a pretty strange thing in themselves, but they're the only way you can keep up.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine a thing like flying boots. Do you believe such a thing could be real?"
9	和	Peace,Japanese Style	Grain,Mouth	禾,口	"When everyone has <radical>grain</radical> in their <radical>mouth</radical>, you will have <kanji>peace</kanji>. That is the <kanji>Japanese style</kanji> of doing things.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine Japanese people with grain in their mouth. The whole country is at peace."	<reading><jp>わ, お</jp></reading>	<jp>なご, やわ</jp>	<jp>かず, より</jp>	わ, お	"<kanji>Peace</kanji> is the <kanji>Japanese style</kanji>. The <reading>wa</reading>lruses (<jp>わ</jp>) living off of Japan see this, and start to emulate.<br><br>

- Hint: The walruses also achieve peace by putting grain in every walrus' mouth, following the Japanese style."
8	研	Sharpen	Stone,Lantern	石,开	"A <radical>stone</radical> <radical>lantern</radical> is an excellent way to <kanji>sharpen</kanji> anything, even in the dark. Your knives, your forks, your spoons, and even your sword.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine walking around at night and you need to sharpen your sword. You walk up to a stone lantern and rub your sword all over it to sharpen it. Touch the blade. Indeed, it's been sharpened!"	<reading><jp>けん</jp></reading>	<jp>と</jp>	None	けん	"Why did you <kanji>sharpen</kanji> your blade? Because you are about to do battle with <reading>Ken</reading> (<jp>けん</jp>), the famous samurai warrior.<br><br>

- Hint: You'll want to remember this character, because he will come up many times throughout your WaniKani journey. Ken the samurai used to work for WaniKani, but then he went rogue because he thought WaniKani wasn't being radical enough. So now he wanders the website carrying his squid friend (who you'll meet later) in a bucket.<br><br>

- Hint: To help you visualize him, imagine a samurai with armor made from crab shells, a helmet that is just an alligator head, and swords with crab claw hand guards. His great beard and mustache are styled in the shape of whatever kanji is giving you the most trouble at the time."
6	後	Behind,After,Back,Later	Loiter,Poop,Winter	彳,幺,夂	"If you <radical>loiter</radical> around to <radical>poop</radical> in <radical>winter</radical> you never know what could be happening <kanji>behind</kanji> you. <kanji>After</kanji> you're done you could turn <kanji>back</kanji> to see something really crazy that you missed because you took so long to poop in the cold.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine trying to loiter while you poop in the winter. You're just trying to take your time as you squat over the snow, but soon you hear things behind you."	<reading><jp>ご, こう</jp></reading>	<jp>うし, あと, のち</jp>	None	ご, こう	"You finally look <kanji>behind</kanji> you and see <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<jp>ご</jp>) and a giant <reading><jp>こう</jp></reading> having a violent battle <kanji>back</kanji> there!<br><br>

- Hint: Godzilla and <jp>こういち</jp> were going at it behind you the entire time you were just lazily taking a poop in the snow?! Ahh, that's so embarrassing! And also dangerous, they could have crushed you! You should look behind you more."
6	安	Relax,Cheap	Roof,Woman	宀,女	"With a <radical>roof</radical> over her head, a <radical>woman</radical> can <kanji>relax</kanji>. She doesn't have to worry about rain or snow or finding a safe place to sleep. The roof also happened to be super <kanji>cheap</kanji>, so she can even relax about her finances.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture the super relaxed woman lounging under her cheap but sturdy roof. Ah, she doesn't have a care in the world!"	<reading><jp>あん</jp></reading>	<jp>やす</jp>	None	あん	"As she <kanji>relax</kanji>es, she pulls out the <kanji>cheap</kanji>est, most relaxing food in the world <reading>an</reading>chovies (<jp>あん</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Think about it: anchovies cost next to nothing, they come in cans, you don't have to cook them or cut them up. You just munch them down. There's nothing more cheap and relaxing than eating anchovies under your own roof."
5	図	Diagram	Mouth,Treasure,Ice	口,メ,冫	"The <radical>treasure</radical>s are in the <radical>mouth</radical> where there’s <radical>ice</radical>. How cryptic! You want to find the treasure, that’s for sure (treasure is great!). It is somewhere where there is ice, so maybe the arctic? What you are looking at is a <kanji>diagram</kanji> which will guide you there.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine looking at a diagram or map – and it has pictures of treasure in an area where ice is. This is where you will find the mystical treasure. This diagram will show the way. You're so excited that you found this map!"	<reading><jp>ず, と</jp></reading>	<jp>え, はか</jp>	None	ず, と	"What will you do when you find these treasures that are shown on the <kanji>diagram</kanji>? Well, you get there, and you find that the treasure is actually a wooly mammoth! What will you do with this wooly mammoth? You grab it and put it in your <reading>zoo</reading> (<jp>ず</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine dragging a wooly mammoth back with you to the town or city you live in, then throwing it in a zoo to be kept. People are quite amazed by this mystical creature you’ve found, though, which is pretty cool."
5	何	What	Leader,Lip Ring	ｲ,可	"Our <radical>leader</radical> has a <radical>lip ring</radical>. Wait, our leader has a lip ring? <kanji>WHAT</kanji>??<br><br>

- Hint: Think of our president (or your prime minister, or dictator, or whatever) and imagine this person appearing on television one morning with a big ol' lip ring. Feel surprised by it. Just say ""What??"" over and over again. You want to have the feeling of ""what"" in you when you imagine this - that'll help you to remember this kanji's meaning."	<jp>か</jp>	<reading><jp>なに, なん</jp></reading>	None	なに, なん	"The leader with his lip ring is now eating some <reading>naan</reading> (<jp>なん</jp>) and curry. It's delicious, of course... but then he gets it caught on his lip ring, and tears half his lip off. He screams: ""<reading>Nannnnn eeeeeeeeeehhh</reading>!!"" (<jp>なに</jp>) in anger at the naan and curry.<br><br>

- Hint: Make this one vivid and scary. He's eating the naan (that's your <jp>なん</jp>), and then he screams at the naan but gets overwhelmed with pain (that's the <jp>なに</jp>). Smell the naan (you're there) and see the blood gushing out of his/her lip. It's terrifying. How did the naan even catch on his lip ring anyways?"
5	羽	Feather,Feathers,Wing,Wings	Feathers	羽	"The <radical>feather</radical> radical and <kanji>feather</kanji> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.<br><br>

- Hint: Have you been studying your radicals? If so, this'll be easy!"	<jp>う</jp>	<reading><jp>はね, は, わ</jp></reading>	None	はね, は, わ	"All these <kanji>feather</kanji>s. You're a bird man / woman, and you're getting ready to fly. Just as you're about to take off, someone dumps you with <reading>honey</reading> <jp>はね</jp> and you're all goopy, unable to go anywhere.<br><br>

- Hint: Taste the honey, feel it all over your feathers. Go ahead and plummet towards the ground (because you were jumping off a building to fly when someone doused you with honey). At least it's a tasty way to go, no?"
5	米	Rice,America	Rice	米	"The <radical>rice</radical> radical and <kanji>rice</kanji> are the same in looks as well as in meaning. This also refers to ""America,"" maybe because America is covered in rice or fields or something?<br><br>

- Hint: Aren't radicals nice? They make things so much easier... if you've been studying them."	<reading><jp>べい, まい</jp></reading>	<jp>こめ</jp>	None	べい, まい	"You've got tons of dry grains of <kanji>rice</kanji>. You have no idea what you're going to do with it. Then, you come up with a solution. All this dry rice could go towards filling up the <reading>bay</reading> (<jp>べい</jp>), so you have more land to farm on!<br><br>

- Hint: In your mind, bulldoze the rice into the bay, watching it fill it up, then pile high. It's not particularly good looking land, but it'll do, and it's already full of seeds, so that's pretty good. The important thing is that you think you have way too much of the stuff, so the only way to get rid of it is to dump it in a large body of water, and that large body of water is a bay."
4	早	Early,Fast,Quick	Sun,Cross	日,十	"When the <radical>sun</radical> is over the <radical>cross</radical> it's time to go to church... which is so darn <kanji>early</kanji>. And if you want to get to church early, you need to be <kanji>fast</kanji>, otherwise you'll be too late.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the sun coming up slowly, over the horizon. It then lines up with the cross, and at that moment, your alarm goes off, waking you up. You check the alarm clock, and instead of displaying the time, it just says EARLY and FAST on it, flashing in big red letters and alternating."	<reading><jp>そう</jp></reading>	<jp>はや, さ</jp>	None	そう	"To remember the <jp>そう</jp> reading we use the word ""soul.""<br><br>

When you're forced to get up <kanji>fast</kanji> and <kanji>early</kanji> you can feel it in your <reading>sou</reading>l (<jp>そう</jp>). You're so tired and it's so early, your soul cries out, ""Please don't make me go this fast this early. I'm gonna leave your body if you keep this up!""<br><br>

- Hint: But you get your soul up early and head to the church fast anyway, because you're doing all of this for your soul in the first place!"
4	申	Say Humbly,Say,Humbly Say	Cross,Mouth	十,口	"There’s a <radical>cross</radical> in your <radical>mouth</radical>, so the things you say are very pious. Everything you say you <kanji>say humbly</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine yourself with a cross in your mouth, saying all kinds of humble things. ""Oh no, I'm not that good."" ""Oh no, my mustache doesn't look that great."""	<jp>しん</jp>	<reading><jp>もう</jp></reading>	None	もう	"When you think of saying humble things, think of the humblest man in the world. His name is <reading>Moe</reading> (<jp>もう</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine this character in your head. If it helps, you can take a Moe you already know of (Simpsons, perhaps?) and pretend he's extremely humble - ridiculously so. Just remember to make it crazy so you can remember it better."
4	氷	Ice	Water,Drop	水,丶	"You have <radical>water</radical> already... and it's pretty cold. All it takes is one cold <radical>drop</radical> of liquid nitrogen added to it to turn it into one big block of ice, just like that.<br><br>

- Hint: Go ahead and touch it... wow, it's really cold - and only from one drop, too. Feel the burn on your finger from where you touched the <kanji>ice</kanji>."	<jp>ひょう</jp>	<reading><jp>こおり</jp></reading>	None	こおり	"When you think of <kanji>ice</kanji>, I want you to think of someone frozen with ice. Do you know anyone named <reading>Corey</reading> (<jp>こおり</jp>)? Anyone famous named Corey, perhaps Corey Feldman? Imagine this Corey person frozen solid with ice.<br><br>

- Hint: How did this happen? Was it your fault? Imagine the situation that would get Corey frozen like this."
4	去	Past	Dirt,Private	土,ム	"If someone tries to dig up <radical>private</radical> <radical>dirt</radical> on you, tell them no thanks, that stuff is in the <kanji>past</kanji>. Some things should stay in the past. Not everyone needs to know everything about your life and your past.<br><br>

- Hint: Keep your private dirt in the past. It's better for everyone."	<reading><jp>きょ, こ</jp></reading>	<jp>さ</jp>	None	きょ, こ	"To remember the reading <jp>きょ</jp>, we'll use ""Little Kyoto."" This will differentiate <jp>きょ</jp> from <jp>きょう</jp>, which is regular-sized Kyoto. Get it? You decide to bury all this private dirt from your <kanji>past</kanji> in Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<jp>きょ</jp>). That stuff is from when you were just a little <reading><jp>子</jp></reading> (<jp>こ</jp>) and you don't like to think about it.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine physically, literally burying your past <jp>子</jp> self. If you hide it in Little Kyoto, no one will ever be able to dig it up."
2	犬	Dog	Dog	犬	"The <radical>dog</radical> radical and <kanji>dog</kanji> kanji are exactly the same!<br><br>

- Hint: Soon there will be very few kanji/radical-same combos ... so enjoy it while you can."	<jp>けん</jp>	<reading><jp>いぬ</jp></reading>	None	いぬ	"You see an emu running towards you from off in the distance (strange to see an emu in these parts...). As it gets closer, you realize that it's not an emu at all, it's something that sounds the same, or similar... an <reading>inu</reading>!<br><br>

- Hint: There's a good chance you know the word for dog in Japanese already too. If so, you're ahead of the game. If not, do your best to learn the reading before moving on."
2	刀	Sword,Katana	Sword	刀	"The radical and the meaning of this kanji are almost the same! The radical is <radical>sword</radical>, but we're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese <kanji>sword</kanji>? That's right, the most common is a <kanji>katana</kanji>, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.<br><br>

- Hint: The progression on this one is important. When you think ""sword"" you have to think, ""What kinds of swords do Japanese people have?"" Then you'll reach the meaning of this kanji on your own."	<reading><jp>とう</jp></reading>	<jp>かたな</jp>	None	とう	"So now you have this sweet <kanji>katana</kanji> in your hands and you're swinging it around like an idiot. Feel free to make whooshing noises as you swing it around. To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to <reading><jp>とう</jp></reading> (That's Tokyo!). <jp>とうきょう</jp> has the best sword and katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to <jp>とうきょう</jp>.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine trying to travel to <jp>とうきょう</jp> with your katana. Airport security is not happy with you trying to take a katana on the plane, so you get a full cavity search. I hope you don't have any other swords hidden anywhere."
1	工	Construction,Industry	Construction	工	"The <radical>construction</radical> radical and the <kanji>construction</kanji> kanji are the same!<br><br>

This kanji also means <kanji>industry</kanji>, which is what construction is, if you think about it. It's all part of the construction industry.<br><br>

- Hint: Know your radicals and you'll know this kanji's meaning."	<reading><jp>こう, く</jp></reading>	None	None	こう, く	"For kanji that use the <jp>こう</jp> (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character <jp>こういち</jp> every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see <jp>こう</jp>, think <jp>こういち</jp>.<br><br>

You see some <kanji>construction</kanji> in front of you. There, standing shirtless (only a suspender and hard hat) is (<reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>), looking back at you.<br><br>

- Hint: If <jp>こういち</jp> as a construction worker standing in a construction site some how doesn't make your legs tremble, that's okay and totally normal. Do make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants!?). Why is he using that bulldozer like that?<br><br>

- Hint: Alternatively, say you really do like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better looking version of <jp>こういち</jp>'s actual face, though). You and <jp>こういち</jp> make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a very deep conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it.<br><br>

- Hint: Hint: When you see <jp>工</jp> in a kanji it will often take the <jp>こう</jp> reading. Remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!"
1	女	Woman	Woman	女	"The radical for <radical>woman</radical> and the kanji for <kanji>woman</kanji> are exactly the same.<br><br>

- Hint: That means if you know your radicals well, you know the meaning of this kanji as well! How swell."	<reading><jp>じょ</jp></reading>	<jp>おんな, め</jp>	None	じょ	"When you think of a <kanji>woman</kanji>, think of <reading>Jo</reading>-Anne (<jp>じょ</jp>), though she usually goes by just ""Jo.""<br><br>

- Hint: Whenever the reading <jp>じょ</jp> comes up, we will use the character Jo-Anne. She's quite a short woman, which is to help us differentiate <jp>じょ</jp> from <jp>じょう</jp> (who is the giant, oafish farmhand Jourm). <jp>じょ</jp> is a smaller lady, <jp>じょう</jp> is a giant man."
1	十	Ten	Cross	十	"This <radical>cross</radical> is the symbol for the number <kanji>ten</kanji>. A good way to remember this is to think about all the religions that have crosses and also important sets of tens. <br><br>

- Hint: If you're familiar with Christianity, they have a cross and ten commandments. Cross = ten, you see?"	<reading><jp>じゅう</jp></reading>	<jp>とお</jp>	None	じゅう	"This cross in particular has <kanji>ten</kanji> <reading>jew</reading>els (<jp>じゅう</jp>) on it. Two on each arm and two in the middle. That's ten jewels!<br><br>

- Hint: Picture the jewels on this cross. Maybe draw it out on a piece of paper so the visual really sticks. Each cross is really a symbol for different sets of ten things, and in this case, it's ten jewels."
1	八	Eight	Fins	ハ	"This isn't exactly the same as the <radical>fins</radical> radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly ""modified radical"" version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? <kanji>Eight</kanji> fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.<br><br>

- Hint: Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think ""Wow, I have to smell all eight of these?"" Yes, you do."	<reading><jp>はち</jp></reading>	<jp>や, よう</jp>	None	はち	"After you count and smell all <kanji>eight</kanji> of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large <reading>hatch</reading> (<jp>はち</jp>) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.<br><br>

- Hint: You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?"
6	東	East	Tree,Sun	木,日	"Behind that <radical>tree</radical> the <radical>sun</radical> is rising in the <kanji>east</kanji>. The sun always rises in the east, so if you head that way, past the tree, you'll be going east too.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture the sun behind the tree, don't picture the sun alone, you'll burn your eyes. It's slowly coming up behind it. Now think: where does the sun rise? In the east!"	<reading><jp>とう</jp></reading>	<jp>ひがし</jp>	None	とう	"You walk <kanji>east</kanji> for a few hours until you finally come to a city. It's <reading><jp>とう</jp></reading>. Oh! <jp>とうきょう</jp> is in the east. I get it now!<br><br>

- Hint: When you think about East Japan think about <jp>とうきょう</jp>. And if you're bad at geography, just look at a map for a while. Or, stand outside in the morning, watch the sun rise behind the trees, and point that way. That's east, it's where <jp>とうきょう</jp> is!"

- Hint: Compare this kanji to the car kanji, <jp>車</jp>. See how the sides and top are different? Use that to remember that this car looks like it’s falling apart.

If the towel doesn't have a greater width than the scarecrow, some of it will be showing. Which you definitely don't want.<br><br>

- Hint: The scarecrow creeps you out.

This may seem counterintuitive, but by doing this they can fit so much more jet fuel. The jet zooms off and keeps going for a long, long time, until it reaches the <kanji>end</kanji> of the earth.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the end of the earth being like how they imagined it pre-Columbus era. Just a big drop going off into space, giant waterfalls plummeting down.

- Hint: Imagine yourself getting mixed up in this situation and the pterodactyl sized condor picking you up. Feel the condor’s talons digging into your shoulders as it grabs you up and flies you towards the sun."

- Hint: Yonder is a bit of a weird word, but it fits the meaning of this kanji quite well. You'll have to trust me that it's more useful in Japanese than it is in English. When you imagine through this mnemonic, make sure the drop comes from the side and hits you in the mustache with quite a bit of force. That means it came from a far distance thus making you look over ""yonder."""	<reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>	<jp>む</jp>	<jp>なた</jp>	こう	"Who shot this drop at you from <kanji>yonder</kanji>?

How inconsiderate.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine this in your head. A traffic jam on a little slide, all because the shogun is using it.

The sheep have been genetically combined with fish, so the sheep have fins (and they've lost their tails - which is why the tail part of the sheep radical is missing in this kanji!). These sheep fins are very rich in nutrients and as such are very good for foster children that need to grow up big and strong.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine eating a fish fin with sheep wool on it. It tastes fishy like the ocean but the wool tastes like clothes. It’s probably the worst thing ever. Imagine eating something like this and taste its flavor on your tongue."	<reading><jp>よう</jp></reading>	<jp>やしな</jp>	None	よう	"The best way to <kanji>foster</kanji> a better relationship with these foster kids would be to give them some <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<jp>よう</jp>). Maybe they can dip the sheep fins in the yogurt to help mask the strange taste. Yogurt is also very nutritious, so it’s a good supplement to the foster kids’ diet.<br><br>
