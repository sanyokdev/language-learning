Just one bamboo wide, over and over. That is simplicity.	<kanji>Simplicity</kanji> is what Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) always demanded.

The genius’ visiting hours are over, so the gate is closed. This genius has been genetically modified to know more than any human could know, and his days are spent answering questions and advising. But now, his work day is over, so his gates are closed.	See the genius sitting behind the gate as it creaks closed in front of you. Hear the gate slam closed as you keep in mind that this genius has been modified to have increased intelligence because the genius radical in this kanji is modified as well.	On the other side of the <kanji>closed</kanji> gates there is still a line of people that want the genius's advice. They decide to keep waiting until morning and gather together some <reading>hay</reading> (<ja>へい</ja>) so that sleeping outside won't be so awful.	Picture a bunch of people in front of closed gates, sleeping in piles of hay. Super itchy hay.		5078	-	kanji Lesson_33

You go around writing about and interviewing all the samurai so you can share what they say to everyone who wants to read!	Why hadn't anyone thought of making a samurai magazine before?!	Unfortunately, your <kanji>magazine</kanji> helps the <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) samurai find other samurai... and kill them. None of the samurai want to share their feelings with your magazine anymore, oh no!	"The sheep samurai is ruining your magazine!

Or maybe it's just the window to your soul, and not your house. Like the poetry people say.	Imagine someone looking into a hole that shows your private heart. That's a window. A window you probably should have kept closed. Now everyone is looking in.	You realize that a ton of people are looking into your <kanji>window</kanji> and seeing all your private things. This makes you <reading>mad</reading> (<ja>まど</ja>)! What right do they have to know your private thoughts and desires?!	Look out your window back at the faces.

What else would you expect from something named the “Not Mouth”? The Not Mouth will always say “no”, regardless of the question.	Imagine encountering this Not Mouth. Ask it a question. It answers, “No”. Imagine doing this over and over until you believe that the Not Mouth always says “no”.	You ask the Not Mouth if it is afraid of <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>). The Not Mouth says, “<kanji>no</kanji>”. So you set the Not Mouth on fire. The Not Mouth then screams, “NONONONONONONONONONOOOOOO~!” Looks like someone can’t handle the heat.	Listen as the Not Mouth continues to scream in bloodcurdling agony. Hear the flames flicker as they lick across the Not Mouth’s being.

Picture your new bamboo muscles glowing under your skin with the moon's power. You flex and feel the power coursing through you!	Your special <kanji>muscle</kanji>s and <kanji>tendon</kanji>s have become famous and the <reading>Kin</reading>g (<ja>きん</ja>) of England has requested that you appear in his court! It looks like he wants you to teach his barber surgeons how you got your new muscles.	Imagine standing before the King, explaining in detail how you cut yourself open and replaced your weak human meat with the special muscles you have now. He's staring intently at you, but more so at your shining body than your mouth as you talk.		5082	-	kanji Lesson_33
垂	Kanji	車	Car	radical	Dangle, Drip	Dangle, Drip		<reading>すい</reading>	た			すい	た								This <radical>car</radical> is all weird because it looks like the side is going to <kanji>dangle</kanji> and <kanji>drip</kanji> off or something. The front bumper of the car is dangling off and the sides of the car look like they could drip off at any moment.	Compare this kanji to the car kanji, <ja>車</ja>. See how the sides and top are different? Use that to remember that this car looks like it’s falling apart. See the parts dangle, and hear the drip of car fluids falling out. This car is a wreck.	You see the parts as they <kanji>dangle</kanji> off the car and you get an idea. You could probably <reading>swi</reading>ng (<ja>すい</ja>) on these dangling parts. The parts can probably take some weight still before they <kanji>drip</kanji> off the car, so you might as well swing around on them while you still can.	Imagine yourself swinging off these dangling car parts. Hear the car creak and groan as you swing around on it, causing more fluid to drip out of the car.		5083	-	kanji Lesson_33

They proclaim this at the top of their lungs!	Picture a shadowy shape on top of the roof, proclaiming to the entire town that the new day is here! It's come! And it's also time to get up.	The thing that climbs up on the roof to <kanji>proclaim</kanji> that the new day is here is a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<ja>せん</ja>). Ohoho, did you think I was going to say it was a rooster? Wrong! Centaurs are taller than humans and roosters, so when they climb onto the roof with their horse legs they can see dawn starting before anyone else.	"Picture that shadow on the roof, proclaiming it's a new day, but this time make sure you picture the outline of this centaur. He has a human top half and a horse bottom half. And he's yelling down at you, ""HEY THE SUN IS UP IT'S DAWN GET OUT OF BED!"""		5084	-	kanji Lesson_33

The horns are revered both for their size and potency. The horns can be used in medicine, so they are very valuable, those alcoholic monster horns.	Look at one of these revered horns. Pick it up and feel its weight. It measures very large. Your arms are getting tired from the weight.	The reason you are interested in these <kanji>revered</kanji> horns so much is that your <reading>son</reading> (<ja>そん</ja>) is sick and you need one of these revered horns to make a medicine for your son. Only with the revered power of the horns will you be able to save your son’s life.	Good thing you already have one of these revered horns.

The middle of your heart is the most sacred, special place for people, so it makes sense that those you keep in the middle of your heart are those you are most loyal to.	Who do you feel the most loyalty towards? Imagine them in the middle of your heart. Feel them in your chest. Imagine them, literally inside the middle of your heart.	You pictured <reading>Chew</reading>bacca (<ja>ちゅう</ja>), didn’t you? No? Well you should have. Chewbacca deserves everyone’s <kanji>loyalty</kanji>. Chewbacca is super loyal to you, so he deserves your loyalty back.	Chewbacca is very loyal. Focus on your loyalty to Chewbacca.

Cause only slimy people manipulate other people, so their fingers are slimy and sticky because they're covered in your syrup from mucking up your life.  This also has another meaning: <kanji>chastity</kanji>. Just imagine if someone wanted you to keep your chastity and they called s.e.x. when someone ""puts their fingers in your syrup."" That would be pretty effective, right? Cause it's like, super gross."	"""Ah golly gee wiz, he sure got his fingers all up in my syrup again, dagnabbit."" You know, this saying we say all the time when someone manipulates us into doing something."	If you want to <kanji>manipulate</kanji> someone else it's going to have a permanent effect on your <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Being manipulative isn't cool.

Imagine having a moon and a city inside your lung. Feel their presence as you breathe in and breathe out. Also, <ja>月</ja> often refers to internal organs as well, so remember that when you see this kanji.	Having a moon and city inside your <kanji>lung</kanji> inspires you to write a <reading>hai</reading>ku (<ja>はい</ja>). Perhaps the city and moon are just metaphorical.

Imagine the annoyance with the author for using words that are hard to understand	Unfortunately, the <kanji>author</kanji> is allergic to flowers. They are only allergic to touching them though, so the author is holding the flowers with a pair of <reading>cho</reading>psticks (<ja>ちょ</ja>), really close to their face.

Steam comes out of the coral flowers because they hold a lot of water. They're flowers, but they're coral flowers, so they came from the ocean.
