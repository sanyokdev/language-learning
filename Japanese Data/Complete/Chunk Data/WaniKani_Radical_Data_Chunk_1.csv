4	"<i class=""radical-horns""></i>"	Horns	Can you see the <radical>horns</radical>? You could put these horns on anything. Donkeys, people, monkeys, and so on. That's exactly what we'll be doing when we learn kanji that have horns too.
2	冂	Head	This is the kind of <radical>head</radical> a child might draw—can you imagine it with eyes, nose, mouth, and ears too? Whoever's head this is, it's really square. Maybe it's the head of a . Hmm.
1	山	Mountain	"This is a <radical>mountain</radical>. You'll have to add the lines that make up the top of the mountain if you want it more ""mountain-like."" Also something that might help: sometimes mountains have a couple of smaller peaks coming out the side of the main peak too. Connect the dots and create the mountain in your mind."
1	一	Ground	This radical consists of a single, horizontal stroke. What's the biggest, single, horizontal stroke? That's the <radical>ground</radical>. Look at the ground, look at this radical, now look at the ground again. Kind of the same, right?
5	肉	Meat	"Inside your head, you can only think about people, people, and more people. This is bad, because really all you want is their <radical>meat</radical>, because you're some kind of sick cannibal... you monster. When you think of ""people"" in your head, you're really just thinking about more meat you can eat."
6	灬	Boil	This radical looks like the fire from the burner of a stove or the steam coming up off of a pot of water. That's because this is the <radical>boil</radical> radical. You need to boil a bunch of water over some flames. This radical looks like all of those parts at once!
47	前	Before	The meaning of this radical is the same as the alternative kanji meaning. It means <radical>before</radical>.
2	王	King	This radical is not something anyone can have. Only a <radical>king</radical> can wear this crown upon his head. This radical is the sign of kings. Imagine your favorite king wearing this on their head. It's a pretty distinctive shape—I think you can do it.
1	丶	Drop	This little radical is a <radical>drop</radical> of water or some other liquid. Notice how it's only one drop? Sometimes radicals or kanji will have more than one drop, so it's important that you know how to tell them apart.
38	辟	Hot Pepper	You see something with a flag on it and put it in your mouth. It was spicy! You look at the little flag and it says... <radical>hot pepper</radical>.
13	東	East	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>east</radical>.
5	冫	Ice	"Remember the radical for drop (of liquid)? This is two drops instead of one. When you see two drops, you should think, ""the next stage of water."" What is the next stage? Why, that is <radical>ice</radical>."
13	果	Fruit	Everything's about rice in ancient Japan and China. So the rice paddy that is on the tree isn't rice, of course, it's another kind of food. It's <radical>fruit</radical>!
4	艹	Flowers	See the little things sticking out of the ground? Those little things are pretty little <radical>flowers</radical>. You know they're flowers and not, say, grass, because they're spaced out. You'll learn grass later, and it will be less spaced out, but somewhat similar to this, so keep that in mind!
9	"<i class=""radical-cleat""></i>"	Cleat	There's the bottom of the shoe and the spikes coming out of it. Only one kind of shoe is like this, and that is a <radical>cleat</radical>.

3	心	Heart	Take a good look at this one. It kind of looks like a <radical>heart</radical> (not the stereotypical Valentine’s Day heart, though). Think of a real heart. Basically, there’s a lump (the heart) in the middle, and three lines which make up the arteries that go in and out of the heart to keep you alive. This radical shows up a lot, so it shouldn’t be too hard to learn it as you go along. Remember, lump (heart) plus arteries equals a heart… like, a real heart, not the fake, pretty kind.
5	可	Lip Ring	There's something hooked going into a mouth. Rather than a hook, though, it's a <radical>lip ring</radical>. They used to use fish hooks and nails in the old days. (Glad we don't live in those times anymore!)
7	矛	Spear	Your mama is carrying some kind of elaborate weapon. You look closely and see that it's a <radical>spear</radical>. The pointy end is to the right, and there are some decorations hanging off it. It's a very fancy spear, and you wonder where your mama got it.
6	食	Eat	You put on your hat and go outside to kick something white. It's a big white goose and you killed it with your kick. That's because you're going to cook and <radical>eat</radical> it. Yum!
5	开	Lantern	Think of an old-style <radical>lantern</radical>. It's on top of a few legs (you can only see two from this angle) and it's in a box shaped holder at the top. You can imagine these lining the streets before electricity, right? That's why this radical is a lantern.
11	戈	Drunkard	This is a ceremony radical with a slide radical. Why would someone be sliding on the floor at a ceremony? If they're a <radical>drunkard</radical>, that's why! People love to drink at ceremonies. And there's always at least one drunkard who takes it too far and slides across the floor doing the worm.
1	丿	Slide	Close your eyes and imagine you're a kid again. Now open them and... look! It's a <radical>slide</radical>! Imagine little you sliding down this slide over and over, having a great time. Imagination + emotion makes for good memorization!
2	小	Small	You have fins and you have a barb. A fish that you can stick an entire barb through like this would have to be really <radical>small</radical>, since it's sticking through the whole fish body (which you can imagine by basing the body off the size of the fins compared to the already small barb.)
29	上	Above	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>above</radical>.
2	子	Child	This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, whom (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want your <radical>child</radical> to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine.
6	舌	Tongue	Something is sticking out of a mouth. Something with a thousand little tastebuds on it. It's your <radical>tongue</radical>!

4	ｲ	Leader	This radical technically means person (like <jp>人</jp>), but we're going to shift the meaning a little bit. It's kind of like the person radical, but it's taller and skinnier, standing above the rest of those peons. That's why this is a <radical>leader</radical>, not a regular old person.
3	矢	Arrow	You have a really big gun. Why? Because only big guns will be able to shoot <radical>arrow</radical>s! Bullets are pretty small, so the guns that shoot them can be any size. But you need a big gun if you want to shove an arrow in it and then shoot it at your enemies.
1	口	Mouth	A big, gaping, square hole represents someone opening their giant <radical>mouth</radical> to tell you something stupid.
37	兆	Omen	There's an explosion around your legs. It was just as the fortune teller warned. This is the <radical>omen</radical> she was talking about. Think about what happens after the omen hits. What horrible fortune teller magic will happen???
36	貴	Valuable	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>valuable</radical>.
36	甘	Sweet	This radical is the sun with its hair sticking out. Why is the sun's hair sticking out like this?

Remember it how you'd like.

35	為	Sake	"This radical looks like a big, weird caterpillar bug thing. But, for the sake of everyone's sanity, we'll just call it <radical>sake</radical>, okay? Keep in mind, we mean sake as in ""for the sake of X,"" not as in the alcoholic beverage!"
35	帯	Belt	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>belt</radical>.

33	享	Sock	Best way to put a lid on the mouth of a child is to put a <radical>sock</radical> in that child's mouth. Shuts them up good, it does. Add a nice fat sock and they can't talk anymore, essentially putting a lid on their mouth.

11	兄	Older Brother	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>older brother</radical>.
11	少	Few	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>few</radical>.
11	及	Escalator	Do you remember stairs (<jp>乃</jp>)? This radical is a lot like that, but it has extra bits and pieces. It's still stairs... but it's more complicated. And faster! That's why it's an <radical>escalator</radical> instead!
11	"<i class=""radical-blackjack""></i>"	Blackjack	You have the radical twenty and the kanji one. Put those together and you get 21. What's another name for 21? That's <radical>blackjack</radical>.
11	"<i class=""radical-bear""></i>"	Bear	"This looks like the letter ""B"" which stands for <radical>bear</radical>. B for Bear! The letter B also looks a bit like a bear, if you think about it."
10	隹	Turkey	This looks kind of like the top of the bird radical, but not quite. It's kind of a dumb-looking bird radical top. What's a dumb bird, so dumb that it would look into the sky to drown itself with its mouth open? A <radical>turkey</radical>.
10	圣	Tombstone	There is a stool sticking out of the dirt. You walk up and realize it has writing on it. It's actually a <radical>tombstone</radical>. You can sit on it and remember the people who are below the dirt now.
10	乃	Stairs	See the <radical>stairs</radical> shape on the right side? Also note it's being held up by a pillar or beam or something, to make sure the stairs don't just collapse as you walk up them.

10	曲	Music	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>music</radical>.
10	各	Kiss	When you combine winter and mouth you get... winter mouth! Or at least a mouth that tastes like winter because it's coming in for a <radical>kiss</radical>. Before you go kissing people you eat mints, right? It's common courtesy so you don't give them a mouth full of bad breath. So when you think of a winter mouth, think of a nice, minty kiss!
10	頁	Geoduck	This radical consists of a shellfish with a leaf on it. What is it? The mysterious <radical>geoduck</radical>. It's a very distinct clam-like creature. If you don't know what a geoduck is, look it up. It's quite bizarre. It has a long, leaf-shaped protrusion coming out of its shell body.
10	失	Fault	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>fault</radical>.
10	丙	Dynamite	Doesn't this radical look like one of those old-fashioned <radical>dynamite</radical> plunger things that gets pushed to set the fuse? That makes this dynamite!
10	"<i class=""radical-chinese""></i>"	Chinese	Why is your husband putting flowers in his mouth? It's because he's <radical>Chinese</radical>. It's just something they do over there, you explain. Tea is flower water, this isn't that weird. Chinese people just thought of doing it first.
10	豆	Beans	This radical has a pod (the square in the middle) between the ground and some roots. That pod is going to turn into a plant someday. What plant will it be? Great big <radical>beans</radical>, like the ones from Jack and the Beanstalk.

9	"<i class=""radical-spring""></i>"	Spring	This radical looks like some new plants pushing their way up and out of the soil. That's because this is the <radical>spring</radical> radical. Spring is the season (and the radical) full of new, growing life!
9	癶	Tent	Kind of a strange <radical>tent</radical>, I'll admit, but one that will protect you from things trying to get in (that's why it has all the spikes). It's the best you can do, considering you're in a cloth/plastic building.
9	辛	Spicy	You're standing up on top of a cross. Why? Because you ate something so <radical>spicy</radical> that it caused you to beg Jesus for mercy. You need to save your mouth from the spicy flames. To make sure he hears you, you stand up on the closest cross. Make sure to feel how spicy this is in your mouth to remember it better!
9	"<i class=""radical-pope""></i>"	Pope	Someone has crosses for eyes. That would have to be a really devout Catholic. Who's number one in that field? That would be the <radical>Pope</radical>.
9	台	Machine	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>machine</radical>.
9	介	Jammed In	This radical kind of looks like an arrow, but not an ordinary one. It's curvy and forced, right? Like it's trying to tell you something is being <radical>jammed in</radical> to wherever it's pointing.
9	史	History	A mouth that's talking about treasure... that sounds more like ancient <radical>history</radical> to me. Just because there was treasure buried all over the place back in history, doesn't mean it wasn't found by now. Don't let history take over your life, like it has the person who owns this mouth.
9	"<i class=""radical-yurt""></i>"	Yurt	There's a canopy with a little table and seats inside. This is a <radical>yurt</radical>! It may look like a canopy at first, but when you go inside it has a bunch of nice furniture for you to relax on.
9	覀	Helicopter	This radical looks like a <radical>helicopter</radical> coming straight at you, doesn't it? You can't see the tail part because it's behind the bigger front cab of the helicopter. But you can see the windows and the big spinning blade on top from here.
9	重	Heavy	This radical is made up of a thousand villages. If you tried to lift them, what would it be? <radical>Heavy</radical>! And probably crazy. But just remember how heavy a thousand villages would be.
9	疋	Coat Rack	See all the arms sticking out of this radical? Those are for hanging lots of hats and scarves and coats on because it's a <radical>coat rack</radical>.
9	咅	Clown	<radical>Clown</radical>s do weird tricks. One trick they might do is stand on their mouth (or stand on someone else's mouth). Imagine a clown doing either one of these things to remember this radical: clown.
9	聿	Brush	It's easier to imagine if you turn your head sideways. The left side of this radical is the <radical>brush</radical>. See all the bristles?
8	合	Suit	You find a hat on the ground with a mouth as the design on the front. You think it looks weird, but when you put it on, you find it <radical>suit</radical>s you quite well. Imagine yourself feeling not so sure about this hat at first. But, once you put it on, you feel pleasantly surprised.
8	巳	Snake	"There's two ways to remember this one. First, you could look at this and see it's a coiled up <radical>snake</radical>. Or, if you want, you can imagine it as a snake head, with its face facing to the right (see its open mouth?). We may use either when learning a kanji, but for now you can pick the one that fits best with your memorization style. Just make sure you get to snake when you see this radical.

*Also note that sometimes the coil isn't totally completed (where it connects in the middle of the vertical line)."
8	釆	Sickle	Most of this radical is just the rice radical, but the top part is something coming to cut the rice from its stalk. That, my friend, is the <radical>sickle</radical>. See how the rice is still there? That's because it's in motion. The sickle is literally doing the cutting RIGHT NOW! (And don't confuse this with the grain <jp>禾</jp> radical!)
8	馬	Horse	Don't confuse this radical with the bird <jp>鳥</jp> radical. It looks similar, with the wing on the bottom and the shape on top, but it doesn't have a feather sticking out of the top of its head and it has a long, thick neck. So while it moves fast like it has wings, it's no bird, it's a <radical>horse</radical>.
8	穴	Hole	You have a roof on top of what looks like a volcano. What is the roof covering on the top of the volcano? Why, it's definitely covering the <radical>hole</radical> at the top. I guess someone thought if they built a roof on the volcano hole, none of the lava could come out.
30	"<i class=""radical-hills""></i>"	Hills	See the rolling <radical>hills</radical> with the road going off into the background to another hill? That's why this is the hills radical.
8	比	Compare	This radical is made up of two slightly different versions of the spoon radical (which you should already know). Look closely at these two spoons. <radical>Compare</radical> their differences. Like one of those magazines where you compare two similar pictures. But this time it's with spoons.
8	匚	Cage	This radical is a <radical>cage</radical> because it's covered on all sides but one (the one open side is where the cage door or gate is). There's nothing inside this cage because there's no gate, and whatever was inside has gotten out. I hope it wasn't rabid...
7	黄	Yellow	Flowers that grow out of the ground of a rice paddy after you bury fins there will grow <radical>yellow</radical>. Why? Because yellow is the color of a fish's soul, so planting flowers over their fins will turn them into a nice, pretty yellow. 
7	勿	Wing	See the <radical>wing</radical>? It's kind of like a bat wing with webbing. Either way, it's just a wing.
7	且	Top Hat	This radical looks just like a top hat. That's why it's <radical>top hat</radical>!
7	寺	Temple	This radical looks kind of like a <radical>temple</radical> on a hill, don't you think? With all the layers, n' stuff? Just picture that first horizontal line as the base of the ornate temple balancing on that hill underneath it and you'll have no problem remembering this radical.
7	孝	Teacher	This radical is made up of coffin and child. To keep a child out of a coffin they'll need a good <radical>teacher</radical> to make sure they know not to stick forks in outlets or dance in traffic. That's why this radical is a teacher.
7	几	Table	What happens when you put a flat surface on top of a pair of legs? You get a <radical>table</radical>.
7	卩	Stamp	This radical looks a little like the letter P, right? It's a P printed onto something... wait, it's not printed, it's a <radical>stamp</radical> that's been put on the paper. Peter Parker likes to use stamps instead of pens.
7	豕	Pig	You have the animal radical in this already, that should be a clue. What kind of animal is it? It's in the ground, covered in mud. Also, there are toes laying around with it, because this animal will eat anything (good way to get rid of bodies... I hear). So what's this animal that's covered in mud and eats toes because it will eat anything? It's a <radical>pig</radical>!
7	夫	Husband	The radicals ground and big make up this radical. There's a big guy on the ground... who is that big guy? Embarrassingly, it's your <radical>husband</radical>. Feel the shame that he got knocked down on the ground. By what? Who? How? (It doesn't matter.)
7	門	Gate	This radical already looks like a <radical>gate</radical>, right? Just imagine a big gate with two pillars, one on either side. Then, up above are the doors, which can come down at any moment.
7	魚	Fish	In a prison on a rice paddy they're boiling something. What do you think it is? <radical>Fish!</radical>. What goes better with rice? What's easy to find, making it cheap prison food? Fish, of course!
7	黒	Black	If you boil a village everything will turn <radical>black</radical>. Mostly because you're a crazed murderer, but more so because when you boil a village all the roads melt and coat everything in black tar. Picture it! It looks like Pompeii. (Oof, too soon?)
7	鳥	Bird	See the cool wing on the bottom? See the head with the neat feather coming out of the top? This is a <radical>bird</radical>. Tweet tweet!
6	羊	Sheep	This is a <radical>sheep</radical> and you're looking at it from above. See the two ears and the body of the sheep going back (with all its wool poking out to the side) and then the little tail sticking out the back. What a cute sheep!
6	首	Neck	There are some horns on the ground that you want for yourself. You pick them up and you attach them to your <radical>neck</radical>. Imagine these horns sticking out of your neck. No one can slit your throat now that your neck is protected.
6	マ	Mama	"This radical is just like the katakana character ""ma"" (<jp>マ</jp>). So let's keep things simple and make the radical <radical>mama</radical>."
6	長	Long	You have a modified key radical on top of the kick radical. You kick the key as far as you can, then measure the distance. How <radical>long</radical> did it travel? How long will it take you to find it? How long will you be in trouble for kicking a key into the woods?
6	L	Lion	"This L-shaped radical is the <radical>lion</radical> radical, because ""L is for Lion."" It also looks like a lion's mouth being opened really, really wide. Imagine a lion opening its mouth to yawn. It looks like this radical!"
6	欠	Lack	There's a person in a prison. Why is this person in prison? Because they <radical>lack</radical> the stuff humans need to be around other humans. If you're lacking something (kindness, self-control, etc.) you may do something that makes other people put you in prison. Try to fix what you lack so this won't happen to you.
6	未	Jet	This is like one of those <radical>jet</radical>s that have the little nose-wings going on too. Imagine you're looking at the jet from the top down, this is what it would look like. It's also why this is the jet radical.
6	占	Fortune	Someone has a toe in their mouth. They are a fortune teller telling your <radical>fortune</radical>. But for her to do it, she has to take one of your toes and taste it. This better be a good fortune for you to let someone put your foot in their mouth.
6	亡	Death	There's a lid on a lion. And you're stuck under the lid with the lion, which means you will surely meet your <radical>death</radical>. Or if you don't want to die, think of the poor lion. If you leave a lion under a lid for too long, death will come for it too. Either way, somebody's gonna die today.
6	凵	Box	This <radical>box</radical> is open. There could be any number of things inside, but for now all you need to know is the meaning of this radical, which is box.
6	血	Blood	"There's a little speck of something on your plate (<jp>皿</jp>). ""What is that?"" you ask. Oh no... that speck is <radical>BLOOD</radical>!!! I hope it's blood from a nosebleed you suddenly have and not someone else's blood. (Your waiter is probably gonna get fired, btw.) At least your platelets should stop the bleeding soon. Haha, get it? PLATE-lets? Japanese blood jokes."
6	犭	Animal	This looks like a tail with some hairs coming off of it. It shouldn't be confused with fingers though, because it's curved, and the things sticking out are more erratic, like hair or fur would be. That's why this radical is the <radical>animal</radical> radical.
6	ホ	Angel	First of all, there's a cross making up the middle, which automatically makes this a religion-based radical. That cross is the frame of someone's body and the things coming off of it are wings. This is an <radical>angel</radical>.
1	"<i class=""radical-leaf""></i>"	Leaf	There's a leaf on top and a stem going down out of it, making it the <radical>leaf</radical> radical. It looks kind of like a lilypad, sitting on top of the water with its stem going down to the bottom where the dirt is.
1	"<i class=""radical-gun""></i>"	Gun	This looks a lot like a long <radical>gun</radical> pointing to the right. You have a shoulder rest on the left, and the barrel on the right. Imagine it hanging in a case on the wall in a museum.
1	ハ	Fins	Picture a fish. Now picture the fish a little worse, like a child's drawing of the fish. Now erase the fish's body and... you're left with two <radical>fins</radical>! Do you see these two fins? Yeah, you see them.
1	入	Enter	Watch out! This isn't the person radical, it's something else. What's the difference? The right side is longer than the left side. And on computers, it usually has that extra part sticking out of the top. It kind of looks like a flap opening to a teepee. And what do you do with an opening? You enter it! That's why this radical is <radical>enter</radical>.
1	十	Cross	This radical looks like a <radical>cross</radical>. I mean, just look at it. Two bars going through each other = a cross!
1	工	Construction	You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those, and have a very distinct shape, just like this radical. These girders are used in construction, which is why this radical means <radical>construction</radical>. Funny thing is, you use these girders to put together buildings just like you're going to use this radical to put together kanji!
1	大	Big	This radical looks just like a stick figure—more specifically, a really <radical>big</radical> guy with his arms stretched out nice and big. When you see this radical, just think big, because this guy is really BIG!
1	亅	Barb	"This radical is shaped like a <radical>barb</radical>. Like the kind you'd see on barb wire. Imagine one of these getting stuck to your arm or your clothes. Think about how much it would hurt with that little hook on the end sticking into you. Say out loud, ""Oh dang, I got a barb stuck in me!"""
11	単	Simple	There's some stuff growing out of this rice paddy and there is a cross guarding over it. This rice paddy is owned by a <radical>simple</radical> family that lives the simple life. They grow their rice, pray to their god, and everything is nice and simple. Ahh, I'm jealous.
5	"<i class=""radical-scooter""></i>"	Scooter	This radical is a <radical>scooter</radical>. See the handlebars and the little light? And there's a platform at the bottom you can stand or sit on (if it's one of those nice motorized ones).
30	片	One Sided	This looks a bit like a waiter walking toward you with a platter in their hands... but wait. It's only half of a waiter. It's a <radical>one sided</radical> waiter!
3	巾	Towel	There's something draped over that stick. It's a <radical>towel!</radical>! Imagine taking a wet towel and hanging it over a railing or a stick so it won't get all musty and gross. It would look just like this.
12	亜	Asia	This radical looks like a helicopter on the ground. Or a TIE fighter from above (going to the side). Either way, it's okay because you know where both helicopters and TIE fighters are made: <radical>Asia</radical>! Most aircraft are made in Asia these days, ya know?
28	屯	Barracks	You stick an umbrella with a big slide on it into the mountainside to make your <radical>barracks</radical>. You're going to use these barracks to teach soldiers how to slide slides and hide from bad weather. It's ingenious!
10	辰	Landslide	If you kick a cliff you'll start a <radical>landslide</radical>! Oh no!
24	旦	Dawn	The sun is coming up out of the ground, making this radical <radical>dawn</radical>. Of course, don't confuse this with dusk! You can do that by thinking that the sun is an optimistic and bright thing, so it tends to come up, not go down. (Also, Japan is the Land of the Rising Sun. I mean come on!)
5	里	Village	This is a rice paddy with dirt around it. This is the perfect place to set up a <radical>village</radical>. You have a place to farm and some dirt to live on. What else could you need?
21	斉	Simultaneous	If you're writing while looking at the moon, you can bet someone else is doing it too. People have a habit of looking at the moon <radical>simultaneous</radical>ly.
2	弓	Bow	This radical looks like a fancy composite <radical>bow</radical> people would use to shoot at targets and definitely not any normal living animals. See how the middle part is being pulled back? Imagine holding this bow and firing it at a target shaped like a giant alligator-crab monster.
13	身	Body	"This radical is almost the same as the kanji, but it drops the ""some"" from somebody, making this just a <radical>body</radical>. Like the physical body you're trapped in right now."
22	弗	Dollar	This is a squiggle with two lines through it. Hmmm doesn't that seem familiar? It should, because it's the <radical>dollar</radical> symbol: $. Well, close enough. Just look at this and think, ah yes, a totally normal American dollar.
11	申	Humble	This radical is the same as the kanji you learned earlier, but the meaning is a little different. It's not just for saying things humbly, it's for being <radical>humble</radical> in general. When you see this radical, think about being humble.
8	罒	Net	This is a <radical>net</radical>, spread out over the water. Imagine all the fish you can catch in this net!

16	面	Face	You have a leaf, a mouth, and an eye. Those are all things you'll find on a <radical>face</radical>! Wait, you don't have a leaf growing out of your face? Huh... well just imagine you have a normal human face with a leaf on there somewhere, ya weirdo.
6	刂	Knife	This is a <radical>knife</radical>. See how it has two sharp sides? And there's a little handle at the bottom for the... well the handle. Be careful you don't cut yourself!

2	本	Book	There's a cut right at the base of this tree. Why would someone cut down a tree? To make a <radical>book</radical> out of it! Imagine living in the old days when you'd have to cut down a tree yourself to write or read a book.
36	舛	Dance	You see a cow in the evening. You get closer and realize it's doing a <radical>dance</radical>. All cows dance in the evening. Can you picture it? The cow is dancing, so majestic, in the setting sunlight.
6	禾	Grain	This is a tree with a slide cutting off the top. What do you cut off the top of trees and plants? The <radical>grain</radical>s. Imagine taking a sickle and slicing the grains off rice or wheat. The plant you leave behind will look like this radical. It's a sign that you got a grain of some sort from it.
2	ム	Private	This is a little triangle that's almost completely closed off. When you want to be alone, you hide in a place where you can be in <radical>private</radical>. That's why this is the private radical. You're closing yourself off to the rest of the world, with just a little peephole.
4	ネ	Spirit	This looks just like the katakana character for ne. Ne for necromancer! That makes this a <radical>spirit</radical>, brought back from the grave. OooooOOoooOoo!
29	尞	Charcoal	When the sun gets small, you need to heat up by throwing some big horns in the fire. This turns into charcoal. Nice, toasty <radical>charcoal</radical> that keeps you warm when the sun gets small.
22	充	Allocate	You have some legs and you need to put them in the trash. But you'll get caught if you put them in one trash can. Quick, cut them up and <radical>allocate</radical> them to different trash cans around the city. Then you'll never get caught.
23	亭	Restaurant	"You see a lid on the street with a drawing of a forehead and a mouth on it. Hmm strange. You pick the lid up and reveal... a secret, underground <radical>restaurant</radical>! The mouth + forehead combo was secret street restaurant code for, ""There's good eats down in this here restaurant hole!"""
3	扌	Fingers	This looks like the hand (<jp>手</jp>) radical, but smaller. That's because it's just the <radical>fingers</radical>. You don't always have room for a whole hand to be in a kanji, but there's always space for a few fingers.
2	丁	Street	There's a barb under the ground, holding it in place. This is actually a <radical>street</radical>. All streets have to be secured to the ground with barbs so that they don't slide all over the place. If you tried to pick up the asphalt streets we have today, you'd still find barbs under the ground to keep them there. The more you know! ⭐
17	吉	Good Luck	This is the samurai radical on top of the mouth radical. If you get to hear what a samurai says, you'll have really <radical>good luck</radical>. Samurai are pretty hard to find nowadays, which is probably why my luck has been so bad...
34	堇	Boot	There's something made of leather with some dirt on the bottom of it. It's a <radical>boot</radical>!
17	非	Criminal	You think you see some legs behind those bars. Who gets put behind bars? Only <radical>criminal</radical>s. This criminal is pretty tall, since you only see his legs behind there.
8	殳	Weapon	Stick a table on top of a stool and you end up with a very dangerous <radical>weapon</radical>. Imagine hitting someone with this thing! Or, even better, imagine making someone sit on it. They'd be crushed mentally and emotionally and whatnot. Now that's a scary weapon.
4	宀	Roof	This is a <radical>roof</radical>. You know it's a roof and not a forehead because there's a little chimney sticking out of the top. And foreheads definitely don't have chimneys.
8	易	Easy	If you have wings, flying to the sun will be <radical>easy</radical>. If you try to get there with your wingless, human-body it will not be so easy.
2	土	Dirt	There's a cross drawn on the ground, making this <radical>dirt</radical>. You can draw anything in the dirt, it just happens to be a cross this time. Imagine drawing a cross in the dirt with your finger. Feel the dirt get stuck under your fingernail and never forget.

16	付	Attach	This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>attach</radical>.
7	周	Circumference	Put some dirt around your head and in your mouth to figure out your head's <radical>circumference</radical>. When you pull your head out you'll have the perfect shape of your head, making measuring the circumference easy. Oh, and the dirt in your mouth? That's just for the taste.
4	世	World	There are no circles in kanji, remember? So imagine that these angles are really circles. A little circle in a big circle, with a line running through them. Why, it's the <radical>world</radical>. The world looks just like this, with continents on the globe and a line is the equator. Can you see it?
4	支	Branch	There is a cross growing out of this stool. It's <radical>branch</radical>ing off of it, if you will. The tree that this stool was made of is coming back to life in the form of a branch.

10	束	Bundle	This is a tree with something wrapped around its middle, holding it tight. If you unwrapped that middle part you'd realize it's actually a bunch of trees tied in there. It's a <radical>bundle</radical> of trees!
1	勹	Prison	This looks like an enclosure of sorts - that's why it's a <radical>prison</radical>. It wraps itself around things and locks them in there. Prisons are pretty scary, even before you imagine one slowly floating down from the sky to trap you.
3	用	Task	This looks a bit like a calendar with spaces for you to write in your <radical>task</radical>s for the day. See those blank sections? Make sure you write down your daily tasks, so you don't forget to do something important!

2	文	Writing	This looks like a stool with a lid on it, but it's actually a <radical>writing</radical> desk. Do you see it? It's a nice, quiet place for writing. You can even see the pen sticking up in the middle. Wouldn't you want to do your writing here?

7	己	Oneself	"This looks a bit like a backwards S. S for Self. But it's backwards because you didn't want to mix yourself up with any of the other selves out there, so you flipped it. That's why it means <radical>oneself</radical>. (That's you!)

This radical will appear as things like yourself, herself, etc., so keep that in mind!"

Someone put two somethings on this stick to dry, but they seem to have left them out for way too long. Was it meat? Fish? Cucumbers? You have no clue, but they're two very dry somethings, that's for sure.
40	麦	Wheat	"This radical is the same as the kanji, but you learned that a really long time ago, so here's a reminder of the mnemonic, just in case:

35	将	Commander	Who wears cleats and takes your measurements for so long that icicles start forming on your body? Your <radical>commander</radical>. The commander is very, very particular. And everyone knows the commander has to get everything exactly right. So taking your measurements takes SO long that icicles grow out of your nose. But that's okay. You have to impress your new commander, darn it!
33	"<i class=""radical-coral""></i>"	Coral	In the water is a barb on the ground. It's <radical>coral</radical>. Coral may look pretty, but if you slip in the water and step on it, you're gonna get scratched up. That stuff is roooough.

5	西	West	"You have pi coming out of a mouth. ""3.14,"" it says. We must take the secret of the circle with us, away from here. We must go to a magical place where nobody will persecute us for our math... a place to the <radical>West</radical>!"

5	会	Meet	Under the hat there are two people <radical>meet</radical>ing in private. Look at them huddled up in there. They must have a reason to want to meet in such a private place, but that's not for you to judge. Maybe next time you have to meet with someone you'll hide under a hat with them too.

5	青	Blue	You have life on top of the moon (ignore that life is missing its little slide on the left side). What would life on the moon look like? Well, first of all, they have no air, so they probably look pretty <radical>blue</radical> from asphyxiation. When you meet them, it turns out you're right. They're a civilization of blue people. Imagine them all living up there, being blue and Smurfy.
5	斤	Axe	"This is a strange looking axe, I know. But think of it this way: the letter ""T"" is in the cliff. What is the ""T""? Of course it has to be Mr. T, who's super awesome.

4	士	Samurai	The <radical>samurai</radical> radical looks a lot like the dirt radical. The difference is in the top horizontal line. For samurai, the top is longer because he's holding swords. Dirt can't really hold anything because its arms are too short. So when you see this radical, think: long arms for some long swords. That's a samurai!
4	米	Rice	"Not to be confused with a rice paddy (<jp>田</jp>). This is just raw <radical>rice</radical>, like the grain that grows out of the ground when rice is raw and fresh. When rice is particularly ripe, it'll kind of look like this at the top of the stalks. See the long leaves with the little rice tufts at the top? That's why this radical is ""rice."""
4	赤	Red	There are some legs and fins under the dirt. Imagine yourself looking at all of these severed limbs... there's blood everywhere. No matter how deep you dig, everything is stained <radical>red</radical>.
4	皿	Plate	This is a few <radical>plate</radical>s drying on a rack. They're stacked together in a line. Imagine reaching out and grabbing one of those plates for yourself.

4	寸	Measurement	Have you ever used one of those math compasses? This looks just like one of those because this is the <radical>measurement</radical> radical. Compasses are used to measure things, just like this.
4	主	Master	This king has a drop of water floating above his head. That's because he's not just a king, he's the <radical>master</radical> of water. Master of elements. Master of ALL THINGS!

You like to eat insects, but society seems to think it's wrong. Don't worry, friend. Someday the rest of the world will embrace eating insects like you have.
4	冖	Forehead	Sure, this <radical>forehead</radical> is a bit square, but that's because it's Frankenstein's Monster's forehead. Also, did you notice that this is just the top part of the head (<jp>冂</jp>) radical? This is just the forehead part of that!
4	足	Foot	Do you see the dude doing a flying dragon kick to the right? What does he hit the target with? Obviously it's his <radical>foot</radical>.

4	耳	Ear	This radical is a bit more elaborate than the eye, though similar. In fact, if you go blind, your <radical>ear</radical>s become one of your new senses of sight, which is why this is like another, somewhat modified, eye. You'll even notice little lines sticking out of the eye. That's because ears stick out more than eyes (<jp>目</jp>), which is why this radical is the ear radical.
4	厂	Cliff	See the <radical>cliff</radical>? It's facing towards the west. What ocean is to your west? That's the direction this cliff is facing.
4	弋	Ceremony	This radical looks like a person with a long dress or train running behind them. That's because it's a bride or groom going to their wedding <radical>ceremony</radical>!

So when you see this radical, think of all the different ceremonies you might have to go to in your life and what you'll need to wear.

3	匕	Spoon	This radical looks like a <radical>spoon</radical>! Well, a spoon that's been bent a lot by an angry person or a psychic. Go grab a spoon and try to bend it into this shape. Then hold on to it so you'll never forget that this is the spoon radical!
3	幺	Poop	"There's something sticking out of you while you're in private. It's <radical>poop</radical>! You can't just poop in public, that's illegal and gross in this day and age. So the next time something starts to come out of you when you're in private, think, ""Ah yes, it's poop."""

Also, think about the teachings of religion itself - also pretty old, age-wise. No matter how you look at it, everything about this radical is kind of ""old."""
3	今	Now	"This is a hat on top of the katakana for ""ra."" Think of Ra, the Egyptian god. When is Ra wearing a hat? Right <radical>now</radical>! It's always now, because he never takes it off. No really, look it up, it's true."

3	"<i class=""radical-hat""></i>"	Hat	Do you know those rice paddy hats? The ones shaped just like this radical? That's why this radical is a <radical>hat</radical>.
3	毛	Fur	Do you remember the hair radical? This is like that, except now the hair is attached to a tail. Animals don't usually have hair, though. Instead, they have <radical>fur</radical>.
3	父	Father	"There are fins covering the treasure making up this radical. You pull away the fins and start digging where the X is (because ""X"" marks where the treasure is, right?). When you dig down, instead of finding treasure, you find your <radical>father</radical>. The shock of this in your imagination should help you to remember the meaning of this radical!"
3	戸	Door	Where does a flag usually go? It goes over a <radical>door</radical>. I know the <jp>一</jp> radical usually means ground, but in this case we're going to say the flag is in the doorway (where the <jp>一</jp> is the top of the door).
3	方	Direction	This radical looks like a dude running off to the right. He's heading in a very distinct <radical>direction</radical>. Which direction was it again?
2	白	White	Add a drop of the sun to something and it will turn it <radical>white</radical>. The sun is really strong, so even a single drop will burn anything white. Why do you think so many beaches are white? Even the drops of sunblock you use to stop the sun's rays is white. So when you think of sun drops, think white.
2	水	Water	There are drops of liquid coming out of both sides of this barb. You can imagine the barb being stuck into the ground then pulled out. When it is, <radical>water</radical> comes gushing out of both sides! That's why this radical is water.
2	メ	Treasure	"This radical is <radical>treasure</radical> because ""X marks the spot,"" as they say. Doesn't it look like the X on a pirate treasure map? You want to go find that treasure now, right?!"
2	千	Thousand	"You're in a room, surrounded by slides. Down off the slides tumble cross after cross after cross. They're bouncing in and hitting you in the face, the arm, everywhere... With each cross comes a voice yelling, ""ONE! TWO! THREE HUNDRED! FIVE HUNDRED!"" and so on. You are worried it will never end, because you're starting to drown in the crosses. Then the voice yells out ONE <radical>THOUSAND</radical> and they stop. Still, you can't move. Think about all the numbers being called out, and keep wondering if it'll be the last one. Feel the relief you'd feel if it stops on a thousand, because you won't be buried anymore. The thousand crosses are covering you entirely, over your head, but because they're crosses you can still breathe."
2	刀	Sword	If you look at this radical, it looks like the bottom part of a <radical>sword</radical>—the handle, more specifically. This radical also looks a lot like the power radical (<jp>力</jp>), so don't get them confused. It's missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword radical is 90% of the power radical).
2	止	Stop	There's a giant toe and a stick in the ground in front of you. You're driving your car toward them, but you don't see them until your lights hit them. What would these things cause you to do? Most likely <radical>stop</radical> your car right away.
2	又	Stool	This looks just like a fold-out <radical>stool</radical>, amiright?
2	石	Stone	There's a leaf growing out of a square thing (which is normally a mouth, but not this time). The leaf is growing out of a <radical>stone</radical>. I mean, obviously, because leaves don't grow out of mouths. I hope. Anyway, picture a stone in the middle of nature with a leaf growing out of it or just behind it and you'll never forget this radical!
2	立	Stand	Two sticks are propping up a lid. By doing this, they're making it <radical>stand</radical> up.
2	田	Rice Paddy	Rice paddies are made up of fields with irrigation lines going between them. See the four rice paddies with water flowing between and around them? That's why this radical is <radical>rice paddy</radical>.
2	ナ	Narwhal	"This radical looks like the katakana character <jp>ナ</jp> (na), which we're going to say stands for <radical>narwhal</radical>. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Oh, and don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (<jp>ナ</jp>) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (<jp>メ</jp>), like an ""X."""
2	月	Moon	The <radical>moon</radical> is actually made of the sun, but it has little legs coming off of it leaning towards the left. Why? Because the moon is always running away from the sun as fast as it can. It doesn't want to get caught on fire, so it has to run to stay ahead!
2	中	Middle	There's a stick going right through the <radical>middle</radical> of someone's mouth! Imagine that mouth being yours. Measure the placement of the stick. Perfectly aligned, right in the middle. That's amazing, though to be honest, you probably have bigger problems than measuring the location of this stick in your mouth.
2	儿	Legs	This radical already looks like a pair of <radical>legs</radical>. There's even feet on these legs (unlike the fins radical, which you learned earlier). That's how you know these are legs and not fins (or something else).
2	天	Heaven	There is a two radical and a person radical. The first level of a person's life is on earth. The second level (this level, which is why there's a two radical here) is in heaven. So when you see a person at level 2, you know they're in <radical>heaven</radical>.
2	手	Hand	This one's a little tough to picture, but I believe in you. The barb in the middle is the wrist/arm. Then, there are four regular fingers coming off of it and then one big thumb (the slide radical at the top). So you have four fingers, a thumb, and a wrist. This is what makes up your crazy looking <radical>hand</radical>.
2	彡	Hair	These three streaks flowing off to the side are three strands of hair. Pretty easy to see and remember, right?
2	尸	Flag	See the <radical>flag</radical> in this radical? There's a pole with a flag on the end of it, blowing in the wind. Basically, this radical looks just like a flag.
2	五	Five	"If you use your imagination, this radical actually looks like the number ""5."" You have to remove the vertical line in the bottom left, but once you do that, you have an easy way to remember that this radical means <radical>five</radical>."
2	火	Fire	See the person radical here? It's got things coming off of it... what are those things—OH MY GOD IT'S <radical>FIRE</radical>!!! Help, help! Put the fire out!
2	目	Eye	See the iris in the middle of the eyeball? Remember that there are no round things in kanji, so square things take their place. That makes this a pretty realistic, square <radical>eye</radical>. You just have to squint with your real eyes a bit.
2	夕	Evening	Do you see the prison and drop radicals making up this radical? This prison is holding onto a drop because it's the <radical>evening</radical>. Evening air does a better job of holding on to drops of liquid like this, which is why everything is covered in dew in the morning.
2	犬	Dog	Remember the big guy that helped you remember the big radical? Now the big guy has something on his shoulder... what is that? You look and see that he has a <radical>dog</radical> up there, perched as if it were a parrot or a cat or something. Dogs aren't supposed to be up on people's shoulders like that, but for him? It works!
2	牛	Cow	There's a cross and a gun, with the gun going through the cross. You're using the cross to stabilize your gun, because you need to shoot a <radical>cow</radical> for dinner. You bring your cross because you need to bless the cow once you've killed it (and it's also a good stand for your gun). Poor cow.
1	女	Woman	This radical looks like a wide person made up of two stacked Xs. Women generally have two XXs for chromosomes, and back in the day they were praised for their wide, child-bearing hips. We may not think of women this way anymore, but way back when Japanese was made, this made them think of a <radical>woman</radical>.
1	二	Two	One line plus another line equals <radical>two</radical> lines. This radical represents the number two. Pretty simple, right? Can you guess what three looks like? I bet you can...
1	木	Tree	Do you see the <radical>tree</radical> in here? It has branches, and then it has the foliage coming down diagonally from it, spreading out like a tree would. That's why this radical is a tree.
1	ト	Toe	This radical looks just like the katakana character <jp>ト</jp> (to), which sounds like the word <radical>toe</radical>. So when you see <jp>ト</jp>, think toe.
1	日	Sun	Since there are no circles in Japanese characters, sometimes rectangles or squares have to make do. In this case, this big rectangle is the <radical>sun</radical>. The middle line going through the center horizontally is the equator. Or maybe it's a cloud, moving across the sun. Picture it, but don't actually look at the sun and burn your eyes!
1	"<i class=""radical-stick""></i>"	Stick	This is a <radical>stick</radical>, sticking out of the ground. It even looks like a stick.
1	七	Seven	What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is <radical>seven</radical>, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning!
1	川	River	"This radical already looks like a <radical>river</radical>. See the banks of the river on the side and the flow of the river in the middle? There's even a slight turn in the river too. So when you see this radical, you should think ""river."""
1	力	Power	Imagine a guy flexing his arm downward to show off his steroid-pumped arm. It's huge. It's so full of <radical>power</radical>. RARRRWWWRRR!!
1	人	Person	If you were to draw a <radical>person</radical> with just strokes like you see in kanji, you'd create a stick figure, maybe something like this: <jp>大</jp>. But this is just a person, not someone holding out their arms to show how big they are. So their arms are down, which makes them look like a torso with a pair of legs. Maybe they're walking too, which is why their legs are spread out like that. You can see the person now, can't you?
1	九	Nine	"If you look at this radical in just the right way, you'll notice that it kind of looks like the letters ""n"" and ""i"" (the ""i"" comes from the little flippy-up stroke on the right side). What do the letters ""n"" and ""i"" start spelling? Why, the word <radical>nine</radical>."
1	亠	Lid	This looks like something you'd put on a kettle or a pot, right? It even has a little handle to make sure you don't burn yourself. This is some kind of <radical>lid</radical>.
