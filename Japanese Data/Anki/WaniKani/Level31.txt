Was that what this was supposed to look like? You were so busy overseeing the gold in your pocket, you forgot!	You watch nervously as this model of Genghis Khan is finished.

Say you're looking at a map of the city, with all the buildings laid out on it. There are too many, so you start marking which ones to exclude from the building plans.

Using one’s mouth is a strange way to measure something, but that’s just how Wolverine does things. Once he measures it all out, he’ll know how many construction workers he needs to inquire about working for him.	Imagine Wolverine going around, measuring the construction site with his mouth. Look at him with his mouth wide open, wandering around the site deep in thought. What a weirdo.	You decide to <kanji>inquire</kanji> as to why Wolverine is using his mouth to measure out this construction site. As you get closer you notice his cool ripped <reading>jean</reading>s (<ja>じん</ja>). Instead you inquire how he got such a fresh style. He looks you up and down, pulls out his claws, and tears yours up to match his. You’ve completely forgotten what it was you were asking, but who cares! Look how great you look!	Look down at your ripped up jeans. You’re so fashionable now! Just like good old ‘90s Wolvie.		4774	-	kanji Lesson_31

As you continue thinking about <kanji>how much</kanji> poop this drunkard can take and <kanji>how many</kanji> more poops you can drop on him, he begins to wake up.

Wolverine knows that <kanji>sweep</kanji>ing is good for the <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Plus, if you don't help clean up after you defeat bad guys, you're just as bad as them.

Heck, I’d be surprised if you didn’t fall off the horse and injure yourself.	Imagine trying to write a poem while riding a horse. It’d be really hard to do.

The sigh is a sigh of nostalgia.	Let out a long sigh as you recall memories from China and all the Chinese things you saw and did. Oh, sigh.	Your favorite Chinese thing to do is <reading>tan</reading> (<ja>たん</ja>). You can wander around without your shirt on and tan all day. No one will <kanji>sigh</kanji> or scoff at you, it’s perfectly acceptable. The Chinese just love to get their tan on.	Sigh again as you remember how nice it was to tan everywhere.

You're staring at nothing. Oh, and you're also measuring its diameter.	You need to know the <kanji>diameter</kanji> of each tombstone so you can make <reading>ca</reading>kes (<ja>けい</ja>) for each one.

You feed these <kanji>vegetable</kanji>s (that you didn't even want) to your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>).

Watch this leader as the transformation takes place. Now he doesn’t resemble anything like the leader he used to be. He doesn’t look like the same person. Watch him morph in your head.	The reason he doesn’t <kanji>resemble</kanji> the same person anymore is because he actually resembles a horse now. The leader is now a horse!

If there's too much dirt outside the pool and not enough water inside, it's gonna look weird. We can't have that.	Imagine seeing a pool that isn't equal. It's like a tiny kiddy pool with an inch of water. And it's surrounded by mounds of dirt. No no no, this won't do—add more water to make them equal.	You spend a few hours making sure the water-to-dirt ratio is perfectly <kanji>equal</kanji>, not for yourself, but because the <reading>Kin</reading>g (<ja>きん</ja>) of England told you to. You may agree that equality is important, but it's the King's responsibility to keep things that way. Which is why he ordered you, small peon, to do the equalizing work for him.

You decide to dig even deeper into the <kanji>grave</kanji> out of curiosity and you find a <reading>bow</reading> (<ja>ぼ</ja>) and some arrows. This must be the grave of a great archer!

You try to <kanji>look for</kanji> the pi tree for so long that you can't help but get a very deep <reading>tan</reading> (<ja>たん</ja>).
