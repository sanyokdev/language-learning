井	Radical				Well	Well															Think of this radical like a map you're looking down on. There are four streets going through this small town.

例	Kanji	ｲ, 歹, 刂	Leader, Yakuza, Knife	radical, radical, radical	Example	Example		<reading>れい</reading>	たと			れい	たと								"The <radical>leader</radical> of the <radical>yakuza</radical> shows you his <radical>knife</radical>. He says, ""This is an <kanji>example</kanji> of a knife."""	The leader of the yakuza is just showing you an example of a knife. Maybe to scare you? Why would an example of what a knife is scare you, though? Coming from the leader of the yakuza, this is a weird tactic.	"""This is an <kanji>example</kanji>,"" the leader of the yakuza tells you. Next time, I'll show you an example of a <reading>ray</reading> (<ja>れい</ja>) gun."	Why is the leader of the yakuza showing you examples of weapons, not to mention weapons that aren't real, like ray guns?		2160	-	kanji Lesson_14
卒	Kanji	亠, 人, 十	Lid, Person, Cross	radical, radical, radical	Graduate	Graduate		<reading>そつ</reading>				そつ									A <radical>person</radical> puts a <radical>lid</radical> on their <radical>cross</radical> after they <kanji>graduate</kanji>. It’s a symbolic gesture, putting the lid over the cross, but it’s just what you do when you graduate around these parts.	Imagine a wooden cross and picture yourself putting a lid over it. Visualize this motion in your mind and imagine having to do something like this at your graduation.	Oops, looks like you forgot your lid. Without the lid, you’ll be held back. <reading>So two</reading> (<ja>そつ</ja>) more years now until you can graduate. So two more years, eh? Just for forgetting a lid? Nonsense!	Imagine being held back two more years from graduation. You’d lose all your motivation. Imagine how lousy this would be.		2161	-	kanji Lesson_14
協	Kanji	十, 力	Cross, Power	radical, radical	Cooperation	Cooperation		<reading>きょう</reading>				きょう									Next to the <radical>cross</radical> we combine our <radical>power</radical> <radical>power</radical> <radical>power</radical> so that we have <kanji>cooperation</kanji>. And with our powers combined, we become stronger than we ever could have been apart, lifting the cross above our heads!	The power of cooperation is a *ahem* powerful thing.	Nowhere is the power of cooperation more apparent than in <reading><ja>きょう</ja></reading><ja>と</ja>. When invaders are attacking, when the townspeople want to rebel, when there is a kitty up a tree, the people combine their power from all reaches of Japan and cross into <ja>きょうと</ja> to put a stop to the madness through cooperation.	Imagine being a citizen of <ja>きょうと</ja>. Watch as the powers from your neighboring prefectures march across the border to come cooperate together to stop the bandits that raided your farm. You admire their cooperation. You admire <ja>きょうと</ja>!		2162	-	kanji Lesson_14
参	Kanji	ム, 大, 彡	Private, Big, Hair	radical, radical, radical	Participate	Participate		<reading>さん</reading> <reading>しん</reading>	まい			さん, しん	まい								You can't keep <radical>big</radical> <radical>hair</radical> <radical>private</radical>, so you end up having to <kanji>participate</kanji> in everything. Can you imagine people asking for volunteers and you trying to look inconspicuous with your big hair sticking up and out and all over? Of course they're going to notice you and make you participate.	When you're thinking about your next hair style, if you don't like participating in things, you should think about something you can actually keep more private.	You know who has big hair and loves to <kanji>participate</kanji> in everything? <reading>San</reading>ta-san (<ja>さん</ja>)! Well, his hair is more big on the bottom (it's a beard) than whatever you have on your head, but hair is hair. And he participates in present giving in every house in the world! See? Big hair = participation!	Would you want to participate in Christmas if it meant looking like Santa and visiting every single house on earth?		2163	-	kanji Lesson_14
周	Kanji	周	Circumference	radical	Circumference	Circumference		<reading>しゅう</reading>	まわ			しゅう	まわ								The <radical>circumference</radical> radical and the <kanji>circumference</kanji> kanji are the same!	Know your radicals, yo!	Practice how to measure the <kanji>circumference</kanji> of an item by using your <reading>shoe</reading> (<ja>しゅう</ja>). Your shoe is kind of round, and it's free. I mean it's right there on your foot.	Try to find the circumference of your shoe and then email us with the measurement. I promise you'll never forget this kanji if you actually do it.		2164	-	kanji Lesson_14
囲	Kanji	口, 井	Mouth, Well	radical, radical	Surround	Surround		<reading>い</reading>	かこ			い	かこ								The <radical>mouth</radical> of a <radical>well</radical> will <kanji>surround</kanji> you if you fall into it. The mouth of a well is the opening of the well, and if you fall into that well, the mouth as well as the rest of the well will surround you.	Picture yourself surrounded by this well on all sides. You look up and you can barely see the mouth of the well where you fell in and now you are trapped. Imagine how scared you are. Imagine trying to claw your way up the sides of the well but all you do is break your nails on the walls.	The well walls <kanji>surround</kanji> you as you look up to the mouth once again. This time you see an <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) flying overhead. You call out to the eagle to save you and the eagle comes swooping down into the well and flies you out to safety. What a nice eagle!	This eagle is basically a superhero. Imagine an eagle dressed in a superman outfit. He’s your savior. Imagine your gratitude towards this eagle superhero.		2165	-	kanji Lesson_14

Go ahead and touch that old man's mouth. It's super hard feeling when you touch it.	You touch the old man's <kanji>hard</kanji> mouth and it crumbles away, revealing the face of a <reading><ja>子</ja></reading> (<ja>こ</ja>) inside.	"""You pressed the hard skin holding me captive! Thank you!"" the <ja>子</ja> says, as they break free from their hard mouth prison."		2166	-	kanji Lesson_14
季	Kanji	禾, 子	Grain, Child	radical, radical	Seasons	Seasons		<reading>き</reading>				き									A <radical>grain</radical>'s <radical>child</radical> will grow with the <kanji>seasons</kanji>. In spring the grain is born, it grows in summer, is harvested in fall, and dies in winter.	Watch the grain children live their entire lives throughout the seasons. Though there are 72 seasons in Japan, so the life of a grain is actually really long there.	All of the <kanji>seasons</kanji> have their own special <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). As they change, that season's key appears and unlocks the next step in the grain's life.	Picture these seasonal keys floating through the sky, unlocking the weather changes, the growth of new grains, and the aging of us all.		2167	-	kanji Lesson_14
完	Kanji	宀, 元	Roof, Origin	radical, radical	Perfect	Perfect		<reading>かん</reading>				かん									The <radical>roof</radical> that became the <radical>origin</radical> of all roofs was <kanji>perfect</kanji>. It was tall and wide so it could fit and protect everyone. And the dimensions were perfect too.	Picture this absolutely perfect roof. They really got it right on their first try.	This <kanji>perfect</kanji> roof was commissioned by Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>). We got all of the carpenters and home makers and construction workers he'd conquered together and tasked them with making the first roof, but only if they made it absolutely perfect.	Genghis Khan was a perfectionist, and by conquering and bringing all of these different people together, he was able to create something perfect by all standards.		2168	-	kanji Lesson_14
希	Kanji	メ, ナ, 巾	Treasure, Narwhal, Towel	radical, radical, radical	Wish	Wish		<reading>き</reading>	まれ			き	まれ								There is a <radical>treasure</radical> on top of a <radical>narwhal</radical> who wears a <radical>towel</radical> that will grant your greatest <kanji>wish</kanji>.	"Picture this narwhal: above its long horn there is a huge, shiny treasure floating. It pulls the towel tight around itself, ""Brururu you found me I see!"" it whistles at you."	In order to open the treasure and get your <kanji>wish</kanji>, you need the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). The narwhal knows where it's hidden, so you'll have to convince it to tell you where the key is.	If you find the key, what will you wish for? Think about your single, greatest wish. Close your eyes and picture it as clearly as you can and you'll find the key.		2169	-	kanji Lesson_14
念	Kanji	今, 心	Now, Heart	radical, radical	Thought	Thought		<reading>ねん</reading>				ねん									If you live in the <radical>now</radical>, there’s a good chance your <radical>heart</radical> controls your <kanji>thought</kanji> process. You don’t have time to think with your brain, you need an answer now so you use your heart to make decisions and thought process.	Think about the last time you thought it was right to make a decision with your heart. What was it? Use these emotions to remember this kanji.	You're living in the now and letting your heart control all your <kanji>thought</kanji>s. Why are you following your heart? You found you only have one <reading><ja>年</ja></reading> (<ja>ねん</ja>) to live, so you have to live for the now.	Think of all the things you'd do with your life if you only had one <ja>年</ja> left. Maybe you should go do some of them anyways, right now?		2170	-	kanji Lesson_14
折	Kanji	扌, 斤	Fingers, Axe	radical, radical	Fold, Bend	Fold, Bend		<reading>せつ</reading>	お			せつ	お								If your <radical>fingers</radical> are strong enough you can take an <radical>axe</radical> and <kanji>fold</kanji> it in half. Bad men were cutting down all the forests, so you're going around <kanji>bend</kanji>ing their axes so they can't cut trees down anymore.	Imagine holding an axe between your fingers and folding it like a pretzel. Or some silly putty. Or a really soft axe.	Unfortunately, as you <kanji>fold</kanji> these axes in half you realize they come in <reading>sets</reading> (<ja>せつ</ja>), so there are twice the axes you thought there would be. To compensate, you start folding them in sets too.	How many axes can you bend at once? A set of two? What about a set of four? Or a set of forty-two?		2171	-	kanji Lesson_14
望	Kanji	亡, 月, 王	Death, Moon, King	radical, radical, radical	Hope	Hope		<reading>ぼう</reading>	のぞ			ぼう	のぞ								"Causing <radical>death</radical> at every turn, the <radical>moon</radical> <radical>king</radical> sits inside his moon, getting ready to cause death on anything in his sights. Sounds a lot like the Death Star from a certain movie. One of which is ""Star Wars: A New <kanji>Hope</kanji>."""	Now picture the death moon king as the Emperor, sitting in his Death Star. There is no hope, except for that little opening you can shoot through to destroy the whole thing. That's hope, I guess!	The name A New <kanji>Hope</kanji>, as we all know, comes from the ending where the moon king's son sends a <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) ball into that little opening and knocks it out of the sky.	In the end, the real hope was bowling all along. I hope you've learned a valuable lesson from this space movie.		2172	-	kanji Lesson_14
材	Kanji	木, 才	Tree, Genius	radical, radical	Lumber, Material, Timber	Lumber, Material, Timber		<reading>ざい</reading>				ざい									A <radical>tree</radical> to a <radical>genius</radical> immediately becomes <kanji>lumber</kanji>. They can look at the tree and see more: the ability to turn it into lumber into <kanji>material</kanji> and use it for a million different things.	Picture the genius staring at a large tree. Math symbols and equations fly around in their head, until finally a little lightbulb and a pile of lumber appear above their head.	This genius doesn't want to use the <kanji>lumber</kanji> to build a house or a chair, no no, they're going to use these <kanji>material</kanji>s to build a <reading>xy</reading>lophone (<ja>ざい</ja>)! The most difficult instrument to create!!	Watch as the tree becomes lumber and that lumber is used to craft a ginormous xylophone. Each key is its own plank of lumber!		2173	-	kanji Lesson_14
束	Kanji	束	Bundle	radical	Bundle	Bundle		<reading>そく</reading>	たば			そく	たば								The <radical>bundle</radical> radical and the <kanji>bundle</kanji> kanji are the same!	Know your radicals, yo!	You should always <kanji>bundle</kanji> your <reading>sock</reading>s (<ja>そく</ja>). If you don't, there is a 100% chance you'll lose all of the left ones.	Imagine doing laundry and making sure to bundle your socks together so none of them will be lost.		2174	-	kanji Lesson_14
松	Kanji	木, 公	Tree, Public	radical, radical	Pine, Pine Tree	Pine, Pine Tree		しょう	<reading>まつ</reading>			まつ	しょう								When climbing a <radical>tree</radical> in <radical>public</radical>, it’s best to choose a <kanji>pine</kanji>. Pine trees offer the most coverage, so you’ll be able to hide, even out in public.	Imagine climbing up a pine tree. The pine needles are prickly, so your hands get pricked as you climb. Smell the pine tree smell and feel the pine sap on your hands.	In case you fall, someone has laid <reading>mats</reading> (<ja>まつ</ja>) out around the base of the <kanji>pine</kanji> tree. That way, you’ll land on the mats should something unfortunate happen.	Picture yourself falling out of this pine tree and onto the mats. The mats are nice and soft so it’s nice.

The <kanji>remainder</kanji> of them aren't even in Japan.	Imagine the yakuza bars all being shut down. There's only one place where they can remain.	The <kanji>remainder</kanji> of the yakuza bars aren't in Japan. Strangely, they are all in <reading>Zan</reading>zibar (<ja>ざん</ja>).	Imagine a yakuza bar in Zanzibar.

的	Kanji	白, 勺	White, Pool	radical, radical	Target, Al, ~Al, Like, ~Like	Target, Al, ~Al, Like, ~Like		<reading>てき</reading>	まと			てき	まと								A <radical>white</radical> guy jumps into a <radical>pool</radical> with a <kanji>target</kanji> painted on the bottom. He’s aiming for the bullseye.	Picture this pasty white dude jumping into the target bottomed pool. The sun glints off of his unnaturally white skin and stings your eyes.	This white dude is a huge <reading>techie</reading> (<ja>てき</ja>) so he has electronic enhancements that make sure he hits the <kanji>target</kanji>. Being a techie has its advantages.	He hits the water right on target and the water splashes onto you. Since he was a techie, he was able to perform the perfect dive. And now you’re all wet.		2177	-	kanji Lesson_14
約	Kanji	糸, 勺	Thread, Pool	radical, radical	Promise	Promise		<reading>やく</reading>				やく									You tie a <radical>thread</radical> on your finger before jumping in the <radical>pool</radical> to remind yourself of the <kanji>promise</kanji> you made to your mother. The thread represents the promise you made to mow the lawn after you finished swimming in the pool.	The promise reminding thread on your finger was tied too tight. You can feel the thread starting to cut off your circulation as your finger starts to turn purple and go numb. It’s really uncomfortable.	After you get out of the pool, you keep the <kanji>promise</kanji> you made to your mother. So you get on your <reading>yak</reading> (<ja>やく</ja>) powered mower and trim the grass. Yes, your mower is pulled by a yak. It’s very efficient.	Imagine yourself sitting on a riding mower as you’re pulled around the yard by a yak.

Imagine acting in a play or a movie where there are flowers and clouds all around you. You're singing and smiling and dancing and acting your absolute heart out!	You have to do some <kanji>acting</kanji> that involves you being <reading>gay</reading> (<ja>げい</ja>). You should imagine this scene, whether you're gay and it's not actual acting or not.	Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it. Whatever happens, feel that emotion well up, as the flowers and clouds spin around you, and you act out the scene.		2179	-	kanji Lesson_14
基	Kanji	其, 土	Crab, Dirt	radical, radical	Foundation	Foundation		<reading>き</reading>	もと			き	もと								<radical>Crab</radical>s in the <radical>dirt</radical> make a great <kanji>foundation</kanji> for a seaside hut. It's right on the seashore, where all the crabs dig their holes in the dirt. But as they get old and die, their bodies form a strong base. Perfect for the foundation of a building like this!	Do you live on the beach? Maybe the foundation of your house was made from crabs in dirt too. Why don't you go outside and check?	Remember, a good <kanji>foundation</kanji> is the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) to a good house. No, literally. You have to use a piece of the foundation to make the key to your house.	Keys to houses are always made out of a piece of the foundation it was built upon. How else would they be unique from one another?		2180	-	kanji Lesson_14
性	Kanji	忄, 生	Soul, Life	radical, radical	Gender, Nature, Sex	Gender, Nature, Sex		<reading>せい</reading> <reading>しょう</reading>				せい, しょう									Each <radical>life</radical> has a <radical>soul</radical>, and that soul determines what <kanji>gender</kanji> you are. It's not so much about your body parts, it's more about what's inside that matters.	Picture your own soul and your own life. Listen to what your soul says about your gender and live your life to the fullest!	Once you've decided what your <kanji>gender</kanji> is, the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) comes to your house, lays his <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) on your shoulders, and then it's official! It's in all the newspapers, there's a parade, and everyone is patting you on the back because you did it!	The next time you get one of those surveys where you have to choose your gender just think back to that time your life when the Shougun came and officiated your gender with his saber. Ahh, what lovely memories.		2181	-	kanji Lesson_14
技	Kanji	扌, 支	Fingers, Branch	radical, radical	Skill	Skill		<reading>ぎ</reading>	わざ			ぎ	わざ								You can <radical>branch</radical> out your <radical>fingers</radical>. It's your special <kanji>skill</kanji>. Your fingers branch out into smaller fingers and you can hold things really well. You can type super-duper fast. And you can win any tickle fight. These are skills you have thanks to your branching fingers.	If you could have any skill imaginable, what would it be? Would it be to have these magical branching fingers? (Definitely. It would.)	Unfortunately, these <kanji>skill</kanji>s are too much for the normal skill-less people to handle and they pull out the <reading>gui</reading>llotine (<ja>ぎ</ja>). I guess they're going to chop off your skillful fingers because they're kinda scary.	Imagine a tiny guillotine made for the cutting of fingers. Whoever made this must have had special hand skills too! Maybe they tested it on him...		2182	-	kanji Lesson_14
格	Kanji	木, 各	Tree, Kiss	radical, radical	Status	Status		<reading>かく</reading>				かく									If you <radical>kiss</radical> a <radical>tree</radical>, your <kanji>status</kanji> will change to, “In a relationship with a tree.”	You know Facebook relationship statuses. If you kiss a tree, your status will be that you’re in a relationship with said tree. Imagine how silly that would be.	Regardless of the <kanji>status</kanji>, you need to let the tree know how you feel. Being a <reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>), y'know, a male chicken, you cock-a-doodle-do your true feelings to the tree. You actually just want to be friends.	Picture yourself as a cock, cock-a-doodle-doing about how you really feel about the tree. What would you say to let the tree down easy?		2183	-	kanji Lesson_14

It's the ability to predict the future! The moon spoons reflect the knowledge of time and space into your brain. Now that's a cool ability!	I wish I had this kind of ability... maybe I'll go up to the moon and try to steal your spoons.	This <kanji>ability</kanji> to predict the future makes you famous and now everyone knows your name: <reading>No</reading>stradamus (<ja>のう</ja>)! And now that people know about your name and special ability, everyone will love you!	Oh, you thought I was talking about that old Nostradamus, who also had the ability to predict things?

Carrying drops like that is a real <kanji>art</kanji>. It requires <kanji>technique</kanji>. 	Angels are really good at going around carrying drops! Imagine the artistry and technique involved. I bet they do some kind of dance, and there's lots of sparkly magic.	"Angels are so good at this because they are trained in nin<reading>jutsu</reading> (<ja>じゅつ</ja>), or the ""art of being a ninja."" Everyone knows that ninjas are great at carrying drops on the go!"

Ok, so it doesn’t matter so much if you have a mustache, but if you’re travelling fast enough to make it to the moon, you’re definitely breaking a bone if you run into it.	Imagine the force and mass of the moon hitting you right in the boney part of your forehead. Whomp! It sure would hurt.	Outer space is cold, and if you're traveling to the moon, you're going to need a lot of <reading>coats</reading> (<ja>こつ</ja>). All of these coats will keep you warm, even if you do end up breaking your forehead <kanji>bone</kanji>. 	Again, feel your bones crack as you smash into the moon. At least you're warm though. Feel the cozy coats you're wearing and snuggle up in their warmth.		2186	-	kanji Lesson_14
妥	Kanji	<i class=radical-cleat></i>, 女	Cleat, Woman	radical, radical	Gentle	Gentle		<reading>だ</reading>				だ									A <radical>woman</radical> with <radical>cleat</radical>s is walking on someone's back, but she doesn't want to hurt him. She has to be very <kanji>gentle</kanji>. Cleats are sharp and pointy, and not designed for back walking, so she's being extra, special gentle right now.	Picture a woman walking gently over someone's back. She's hardly moving.	Actually, the person she's being <kanji>gentle</kanji> with is her <reading>da</reading>d (<ja>だ</ja>). No one would ever want to hurt their dad, especially if he's asked you to walk gently on his back as a way of giving him a massage.	Poor, old dad. His back hurts so his daughter has to walk on his back with cleats to make it feel better. But if she isn't gentle enough, she'll just make it worse.		2187	-	kanji Lesson_14
雰	Kanji	雨, 分	Rain, Part	radical, radical	Atmosphere	Atmosphere		<reading>ふん</reading>				ふん									<radical>Part</radical> <radical>rain</radical>, part other stuff. I imagine this is what people thought the <kanji>atmosphere</kanji> was made out of thousands of years ago.	Imagine looking up into the sky, trying to figure out what the atmosphere up there is made out of. Your only lead: It's raining, a lot. So, the atmosphere must be partly made of rain, and it's just falling down.	The reading for this kanji is actually the same as <ja>分</ja>s. One trick about complicated kanji is they often take the reading of one of the pieces that they're made from. In this case it's <ja>分</ja>, which is cool.	Also, studying the <kanji>atmosphere</kanji> is a ton of <reading>fun</reading> (<ja>ふん</ja>), if you're into that sort of thing.		2188	-	kanji Lesson_14
頑	Kanji	元, 頁	Origin, Geoduck	radical, radical	Stubborn	Stubborn		<reading>がん</reading>				がん									The <radical>origin</radical> of the <radical>geoduck</radical> is a pretty <kanji>stubborn</kanji> one. The geoduck race is so stubborn that it refused to evolve into an animal that made any sense. Hence, the origin of the geoduck is one of stubbornness.	You know what a geoduck looks like, right? Does that look like a creature that was looking to change and evolve and be awesome? No, geoducks are weird and stubborn. Imagine how stubborn you’d have to be to not want to evolve into a more attractive animal.	You know who else was <kanji>stubborn</kanji>? <reading>Gan</reading>dhi (<ja>がん</ja>). Gandhi believed in non-violent resistance and he was pretty stubborn about it.	Gandhi’s stubbornness, however, was pretty effective. Everyone knows Gandhi.
