Imagine a never-ending slide that goes deep down inside a building. You can't see anything in the dark around you, you just plunge down and slide forever. And forever is a long time, my friend.	You slide for such a <kanji>long time</kanji> that you get hungry. Luckily, once in a while a <reading>cu</reading>cumber (<ja>きゅう</ja>) comes tumbling down the slide next to you.

The cat pirate then launches into a speech about how they <kanji>welcome</kanji> all kinds of people. Especially <reading>gay</reading> (<ja>げい</ja>) people. He puts a certain emphasis on gay, so you figure that the cat pirate either thinks you're gay or wants you to be.	You're really happy this cat pirate welcomes gay people aboard. Whether that's because you're gay or just because you're a baseline decent human being is up to you.  Also if you aren't the kind of person who would welcome gay people onto your cat pirate ship, you should just leave nyaow.		4920	-	kanji Lesson_32

To further show your <kanji>kindness</kanji>, you chop up some <reading>on</reading>ions (<ja>おん</ja>) for a friend who always cries when they chop onions. The onions make you cry too, so it’s a nice act of kindness that you’re toughing it out for your pal.	Imagine chopping up these onions.

Smell the cherries and see the sakura blossoms falling down all around you. How whimsical.	How do you say <kanji>cherry tree</kanji> in Japanese? <reading>Sakura</reading> (<ja>さくら</ja>). <kanji>Sakura</kanji> is Japanese for cherry tree. I’m sure you’ve probably heard this before, so it shouldn’t be too hard to remember.	Sakura means cherry tree and sakura is the way to pronounce this kanji. Easy!		4924	-	kanji Lesson_32

This <kanji>fluid</kanji> stays in the <ja><reading>駅</reading></ja> (<ja>えき</ja>) longer than anywhere else.

Go ahead and feel your eyeballs moving around in your head. Your eyes aren't just the part on the surface, they're the whole balls in there, attached at the root.	You know who has some pretty good <kanji>eyeball</kanji>s? <reading>Gan</reading>dhi (<ja>がん</ja>). Gandhi used his eyes to see the oppression around him and decided to do something about it.

Well of course, if you remember correctly, all of your ancestors wore top hats when they were alive. This spirit must be your long lost, great great... uh... somebody.	Imagine coming across your long dead top hatted ancestor in spirit form. What would you do? What would you say?	You ask your <kanji>ancestor</kanji> what it wants and it points to the <reading>so</reading>ap (<ja>そ</ja>) by the sink. Soap? It nods at you. I guess your ancestor is here to see the wonders of soap.	Your ancestor didn't come here to see you, it just wanted to learn about soap. Something that they didn't have back when it was alive.

You tie this thread around your finger to remind you of all the exploits you accomplished in your day. Most of them weren’t actually on purpose, so you blame them on poor judgment and accident.	Think up what exploits you accomplished. What sort of things might you have done, but not quite on purpose? Think about how it feels to be exalted for such exploits that were but mere accidents.	One of your <kanji>exploits</kanji> was when you got dressed in the dark and were wearing funny clothes and everyone thought that it was <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>).

Feel their weight in each hand as you examine them with interest. Smell the fish smell and feel the teeth on the combs.	Since the combs <kanji>interest</kanji> you more than the fins, you examine the combs more closely. Taking interest in where they were made, you discover they were made in <ja><reading>きょう</reading>と</ja>. Dang, <ja>きょうと</ja> sure does make some nice combs.

Things in Korea haven't been on the safest side lately, so make sure you have some ways to defend yourself before you go.	You need a good <kanji>defense</kanji> to go to Korea, so you fill your pockets with <reading>a</reading>corns (<ja>えい</ja>). When you get to Korea you plant them all around yourself.

There are nine turkeys in the tree and they’re all holding random, miscellaneous things. How odd.	Look at the turkeys in the tree. There are nine of them and they are all gobbling up a storm. Hear them gobble as you imagine what random, miscellaneous things they are holding.	As if things couldn’t get any more <kanji>random</kanji>, <reading>Zazu</reading> (<ja>ざつ</ja>) from the Lion King flies into the tree and starts asking the nine turkeys <kanji>miscellaneous</kanji> trivia. Zazu always did have a thirst for knowledge, but this is kind of strange.	Look at Zazu asking the turkeys random questions about miscellaneous trivia. You’ve seen the Lion King, right?

Picture the husbands pulling a different side of the shellfish, it pops in two, and they each get a shell. They smile and high five.	Since the husbands were able to <kanji>agree</kanji>, <reading>San</reading>ta-san (<ja>さん</ja>) believes they’re both good husbands and belong on the good list.

Spiders have a little bit in them already, but if you really want to make it potent, smash them in some whiskey to make a deadly acid that will rip through anything.	Imagine crushing up some spiders into alcohol. Watch it turn green. It's going to eat through the beaker! Quick, do something!	You're trying to find a container for this <kanji>acid</kanji> when <reading>San</reading>ta-san (<ja>さん</ja>) bursts through your wall. He frowns down at you. You're on the naughty list now.

机	Kanji	木, 几	Tree, Table	radical, radical	Desk	Desk		き	<reading>つくえ</reading>			つくえ	き								A <radical>tree</radical> combines with a <radical>table</radical> to make a <kanji>desk</kanji>. When you think about it, a desk is just a table with more stuff. To make this more stuff, like drawers and such, you need more wood, and wood comes from trees. Add materials from the tree to the table and you have a desk.	Chop this tree into pieces to transform this table into a desk. Hear the sounds of construction in your head as you make this desk with your bare hands.	When you finish the <kanji>desk</kanji> you turn to your friend and say, “<reading>It’s cool, eh</reading> (<ja>つくえ</ja>)?” Your friend looks at you and says, “S’coo’ eh? What?” “This desk, it’s cool. It’s cool, eh?” “Aw, yeah man. S’coo’ eh.”	Okay, so this is a pretty tricky one to make a reading mnemonic out of, if you can think of a better one, please email us. Until then, just imagine someone slurring “It’s cool, eh?” While you think about how cool this desk really is. Run your hands over the finished project as you say it.		4948	-	kanji Lesson_32

Imagine telling a piece of grain your deepest, darkest secret.	If someone finds out your <kanji>secret</kanji> (not from the grain though, it will certainly keep it) then your entire face will fill with <reading>hea</reading>t (<ja>ひ</ja>).	This works both ways too. If someone tells you a secret, that same heat fills you up.

Most shrimp make a living with their translation skills. They are the translators of the ocean. If they don’t know how to say something in all the languages of the sea, they have no reason to live. They might as well be dead.	Imagine this one shrimp who is bad at translation. He’s trying to find a reason to live, but he’s having trouble. Look at him all alone, being shunned by the other shrimp.	The <kanji>translation</kanji> this shrimp failed to make was for the word “<reading>yak</reading>” (<ja>やく</ja>). The shrimp found no <kanji>reason</kanji> to translate yak because there are no yak in the sea and then the shrimp just started questioning everything in his life and fell apart.	The translation of the word yak was the reason this shrimp fell into despair and gave up the translation profession. Now everyone hates him. See this poor shrimp being harassed by others while they shout at him, “Yak! Yak! Yak!”		4950	-	kanji Lesson_32

The tsunami water mixes with each tree, nine of them actually, and the resulting liquid is a forest green dye.	Imagine this happening in front of you.

The <kanji>dye</kanji> continues to pass through the forest and hits a group of <reading>cen</reading>taurs (<ja>せん</ja>). Now each centaur is dyed with the forest green dye. They don’t look happy.
