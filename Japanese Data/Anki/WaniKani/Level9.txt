介	Radical				Jammed In	Jammed In, Hut															This radical kind of looks like an arrow, but not an ordinary one. It's curvy and forced, right? Like it's trying to tell you something is being <radical>jammed in</radical> to wherever it's pointing.					1257	-	Lesson_9 radical
史	Radical				History	History															A mouth that's talking about treasure... that sounds more like ancient <radical>history</radical> to me. Just because there was treasure buried all over the place back in history, doesn't mean it wasn't found by now. Don't let history take over your life, like it has the person who owns this mouth.					1258	-	Lesson_9 radical
癶	Radical				Tent	Tent															Kind of a strange <radical>tent</radical>, I'll admit, but one that will protect you from things trying to get in (that's why it has all the spikes). It's the best you can do, considering you're in a cloth/plastic building.					1259	-	Lesson_9 radical
咅	Radical				Clown	Clown															<radical>Clown</radical>s do weird tricks. One trick they might do is stand on their mouth (or stand on someone else's mouth). Imagine a clown doing either one of these things to remember this radical: clown.					1260	-	Lesson_9 radical
阝	Radical				Building	Building, Butcher															This radical looks like a curvy letter B. What does B stand for? <radical>Building</radical>! This radical is used in a lot of kanji to mark that it's a building, or that it has something to do with buildings.					1261	-	Lesson_9 radical
辛	Radical				Spicy	Spicy															You're standing up on top of a cross. Why? Because you ate something so <radical>spicy</radical> that it caused you to beg Jesus for mercy. You need to save your mouth from the spicy flames. To make sure he hears you, you stand up on the closest cross. Make sure to feel how spicy this is in your mouth to remember it better!					1262	-	Lesson_9 radical
重	Radical				Heavy	Heavy															This radical is made up of a thousand villages. If you tried to lift them, what would it be? <radical>Heavy</radical>! And probably crazy. But just remember how heavy a thousand villages would be.					1263	-	Lesson_9 radical
反	Radical				Anti	Anti, Devil															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>anti</radical>.					1264	-	Lesson_9 radical

疋	Radical				Coat Rack	Coat Rack															See all the arms sticking out of this radical? Those are for hanging lots of hats and scarves and coats on because it's a <radical>coat rack</radical>.					1268	-	Lesson_9 radical
覀	Radical				Helicopter	Helicopter															This radical looks like a <radical>helicopter</radical> coming straight at you, doesn't it? You can't see the tail part because it's behind the bigger front cab of the helicopter. But you can see the windows and the big spinning blade on top from here.					1269	-	Lesson_9 radical
<i class=radical-cleat></i>	Radical				Cleat	Cleat															There's the bottom of the shoe and the spikes coming out of it. Only one kind of shoe is like this, and that is a <radical>cleat</radical>.					1270	-	Lesson_9 radical
<i class=radical-pope></i>	Radical				Pope	Pope															Someone has crosses for eyes. That would have to be a really devout Catholic. Who's number one in that field? That would be the <radical>Pope</radical>.					1271	-	Lesson_9 radical
<i class=radical-spring></i>	Radical				Spring	Spring, Train															This radical looks like some new plants pushing their way up and out of the soil. That's because this is the <radical>spring</radical> radical. Spring is the season (and the radical) full of new, growing life!					1272	-	Lesson_9 radical
<i class=radical-squid></i>	Radical				Squid	Squid															See the <radical>squid</radical> shape here? There's its head, its body, and its tentacles (two, anyway). Pretty squid-like if you ask me!					1273	-	Lesson_9 radical
<i class=radical-yurt></i>	Radical				Yurt	Yurt, Hick															There's a canopy with a little table and seats inside. This is a <radical>yurt</radical>! It may look like a canopy at first, but when you go inside it has a bunch of nice furniture for you to relax on.					1274	-	Lesson_9 radical
<i class=radical-gladiator></i>	Radical				Gladiator	Gladiator															Someone shoved horns down onto your husband and said he has to fight for them now. They turned him into a <radical>gladiator</radical>! Now your husband has to fight for their amusement. Oh no!					1275	-	Lesson_9 radical
永	Radical				Eternity	Eternity															A drop of water will last for an <radical>eternity</radical>. Do you remember learning about the water cycle in school? A single drop of water can recycle itself this way for all eternity!					1276	-	Lesson_9 radical
売	Kanji	士, 冖, 儿	Samurai, Forehead, Legs	radical, radical, radical	Sell	Sell		<reading>ばい</reading>	う			ばい	う								There’s a <radical>samurai</radical> with (just) his <radical>forehead</radical> and <radical>legs</radical>. Everything in between is missing. What happened to everything in between? He was low on money, so he had to <kanji>sell</kanji> it all, leaving him with only the top and the bottom.	Imagine this terrifying samurai. You have legs… okay, that’s normal. But, then you have just a giant forehead on the top of everything else, walking around. It's pretty scary that someone would sell such important parts of their body.	"If you see a samurai trying to <kanji>sell</kanji> all their body parts here's what you should say, ""<reading>Bye</reading> (<ja>ばい</ja>)!"" and just get the heck out of there. Actually, if anyone tries to sell you a body part you should probably say bye over and over until you can get away from them."	"Imagine saying, ""Bye,"" loudly into the forehead of a samurai trying to sell you the rest of their face. If you say it loud enough it will distract them while you run away."		1277	-	kanji Lesson_9
事	Kanji	十, 口, ヨ	Cross, Mouth, Wolverine	radical, radical, radical	Action, Matter, Thing	Action, Matter, Thing		<reading>じ</reading>	こと つか			じ	こと, つか								You put a <radical>cross</radical> in the <radical>mouth</radical> of a <radical>wolverine</radical>. What a strange <kanji>action</kanji>. Why would you do such a <kanji>thing</kanji>? The fact of the <kanji>matter</kanji> is that you're not too sure why you put that cross in the wolverine's mouth.	Imagine that poor wolverine standing in front of you looking confused, with a cross in its mouth.	This action doesn't impress <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>), who appears and gently removes the cross from the wolverine's mouth.	Imagine Jesus gently taking the cross out of the wolverine's mouth. What a swell dude.		1278	-	kanji Lesson_9

You are a good leader. You have studied the ground and dirt of the earth your entire life. You know the history of the ground and you know how to use it to lead your people.	Smell the ground. Waft the earthy smell of history into your leader-like nostrils. What does it smell like? It smells useful. And also like ground.	You <kanji>use</kanji> the ground to raise <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>). When you were down there sniffing around you realized that your people will flourish best if you use this land for grazing and raising sheep. 	When you use the ground for sheep like this, your people rejoice. You're the best leader ever! You always use everything to your advantage!		1279	-	kanji Lesson_9
具	Kanji	目, 一, ハ	Eye, Ground, Fins	radical, radical, radical	Tool	Tool		<reading>ぐ</reading>				ぐ									An <radical>eye</radical> and <radical>fins</radical> litter the <radical>ground</radical>. What happened? You killed a fish. You must hide the murder <kanji>tool</kanji> before someone finds out it was you.	You feel the panic upon realizing what you've just done. This is murder in the first degree. You used a terrible tool to do it, and now you must hide it.	There’s <reading>goo</reading> (<ja>ぐ</ja>) all over your hands. Goopy goo. It’s the guts of the fish you just killed and it’s dripping off of the <kanji>tool</kanji> as well. Yuck.	That goo is really slimy. It’s disgusting. You feel sick to your stomach. Please don’t throw up, there’s already enough junk on the ground with the eye and fins and all.		1280	-	kanji Lesson_9
受	Kanji	<i class=radical-cleat></i>, 冖, 又	Cleat, Forehead, Stool	radical, radical, radical	Accept, Receive	Accept, Receive		<reading>じゅ</reading>	う			じゅ	う								You’re sitting on a <radical>stool</radical> and someone <radical>cleat</radical>s you in the <radical>forehead</radical> as part of an <kanji>accept</kanji>ance ritual. It’s for the most prestigious Spanish soccer club in the world. You got knocked off the stool, and the cleats really hurt your forehead, but you’re just glad to have been accepted.  This kanji also means <kanji>receive</kanji>, which is quite similar to accept. It shouldn't be too hard to remember.	You’re dealing with a lot of mixed emotions right now. You feel the pain from being cleated in the forehead and knocked clean off your stool, but you’re also glad to have finally been accepted into the soccer club. Suppress your pain. Accept this honor.	After you've been <kanji>accept</kanji>ed, they give you a small <reading>ju</reading>ice (<ja>じゅ</ja>) box to help you recover from the trauma of getting kicked. And you receive it with grace.	Did you ever play soccer as a kid? Do you remember accepting a small juice box into your little kid hands during halftime? Apparently pros drink the same ones.		1281	-	kanji Lesson_9

That is the <kanji>Japanese style</kanji> of doing things.	Imagine Japanese people with grain in their mouth. The whole country is at peace.	<kanji>Peace</kanji> is the <kanji>Japanese style</kanji>. The <reading>wa</reading>lruses (<ja>わ</ja>) living off of Japan see this, and start to emulate.	The walruses also achieve peace by putting grain in every walrus' mouth, following the Japanese style.		1282	-	kanji Lesson_9
定	Kanji	宀, 正	Roof, Correct	radical, radical	Determine	Determine		<reading>てい</reading> <reading>じょう</reading>	さだ			てい, じょう	さだ								A <radical>roof</radical> is <radical>correct</radical> only if you <kanji>determine</kanji> that it is.	"Imagine looking at a roof, and someone asks you, ""Is this roof correct?""  ""I determine it is."""	You <kanji>determine</kanji>d it, but you still have to test this determination. You go to the top and roll a <reading>ta</reading>ter (<ja>てい</ja>) tot down the roof. Tater tots will only roll down a perfectly correct roof.	"""Because of my tater tot roof test, I have once again determined it is correct."""		1283	-	kanji Lesson_9

The world is waking back up from winter and revealing the <kanji>reality</kanji> of what it is all around you. 	Imagine sitting comfortably on your roof as the world around you changes to spring. Snow melts and reveals all of the truths that have been obscured and hidden in winter.	At the moment, you're trying to learn the <kanji>truth</kanji> about the deer that is coming out of the snowy woods when you see not one, but two baby deer appear with it! <reading>Gee! Two</reading> (<ja>じつ</ja>) babies! You keep looking around and realize that all of the animals seem to have two babies that they had hidden in the snow.	Gee! Two babies!

Now even if you sell or lose a piece of <kanji>clothing</kanji>, you'll be able to find it again by checking for your special moon stamp.	Imagine placing each piece of clothing you own onto the stool and carefully stamping them with a symbol of the moon. This should stop people from stealing all of your clothes!	"A few days later you're with a friend when you recognize the <kanji>clothes</kanji> they're wearing. You grab it, rip it off, and scream, ""<reading>F**k</reading> (<ja>ふく</ja>) you!""

We'll be under water for the rest of time and if you can't swim you're not gonna make it.	Picture most of the earth's population already swimming on the tsunami that will last the rest of eternity. Your floaties and life preservers would help you through this mess. You need to swim!	<reading>Oy</reading> (<ja>およ</ja>)! Oy, stop daydreaming about <kanji>swim</kanji>ming and actually do it!

What a strange <kanji>thing</kanji>! You’ve heard of flying pigs before, but cows? This is a new and strange thing indeed! Cows with wings! What a silly thing to imagine.	Imagine if cows could fly. Wouldn’t you be jealous of them? I mean, if a cow can fly, any old thing should be able to, right?	You want a <kanji>thing</kanji> to help you fly with the cow so you put on your flying <reading>boots</reading> (<ja>ぶつ</ja>). Your flying boots are a pretty strange thing in themselves, but they're the only way you can keep up.	Imagine a thing like flying boots.

Old things go through a lot of suffering because their bodies are breaking down. Flowers are no different from you and me.	If an old flower (or person) is <kanji>suffering</kanji>, give them a <reading>coo</reading>kie (<ja>く</ja>).	No one can resist a good cookie.

Think of the last time life gave you a kick, and how you expressed that pain to make it go away.	You need to <kanji>express</kanji> yourself, so you call up a friend and say “Heyo!” (<ja>ひょう</ja>).

We keep the clown part as separate as we can from the rest of the normal people. In fact, the entire clown education <kanji>department</kanji> and their clown <kanji>club</kanji>s have to stay in their part, they can't come in ours.	Of course, we feel terrible about forcing the clowns into their own part of town. It's not that they're lesser than us, it's just that we don't like them.	You see, that <kanji>part</kanji> of town is full of <reading>boo</reading>ze (<ja>ぶ</ja>). Clowns need a lot of booze to keep their charade going, so we just let them have it. But they aren't allowed in our part anymore, because they all stink of nasty clown booze.

This kanji has the same radicals as <ja>和</ja>, but this time the grain is <I>in</I> your mouth, which is why there's little pieces of grain sticking out of the <ja>口</ja> part ;)	Just imagine you're a car or a train and the grain is a person. It's going for a nice ride in your mouth!	You decide the grain is probably lonely on this <kanji>ride</kanji> alone, so you add some <reading>no</reading>ri (<ja>の</ja>) seaweed, so it has a friend.	Now the nori is going for a ride too, woohoo!		1291	-	kanji Lesson_9
客	Kanji	宀, 夂, 口	Roof, Winter, Mouth	radical, radical, radical	Guest, Customer	Guest, Customer		<reading>きゃく</reading>				きゃく									Under your <radical>roof</radical> in <radical>winter</radical> there are more <radical>mouth</radical>s to feed because you let <kanji>guest</kanji>s stay with you when it's cold. Some of them aren't family, so they have to pay to stay under your roof and get food. Those are <kanji>customer</kanji>s.	Picture all of the hungry guests and customers under your roof, eating your food and sleeping on your floor.	One of your <kanji>guest</kanji>s is a regular named <reading>Kyaku</reading> (<ja>きゃく</ja>) the <kanji>customer</kanji>.

Then on this private land you claimed, you build a <kanji>roof</kanji>. Under the roof you also build some <kanji>shop</kanji>s and <kanji>store</kanji>s.	That's the natural next progression of claiming some land. Building a roof upon it and building some shops and stores inside. You'll see why in a moment.	The <kanji>roof</kanji> covering the dirt is there so that the <reading>Ya</reading>nkees (<ja>や</ja>) can play baseball year round. The <kanji>store</kanji>s and <kanji>shop</kanji>s are there to sell hot dogs and Yankees memorabilia.	You have yourself a whole Yankees stadium, and all it took was a roof and some shops / stores!

The degrees change depending on specific <kanji>occurrence</kanji>s.	Since a yurt is round, the stool has to be angled at certain degrees. It's part of yurt culture. Imagine someone adjusting the stool with a measurement tool to adjust it to an exact degree.	Also angled at exact <kanji>degrees</kanji> is the <reading>do</reading>g (<ja>ど</ja>).	The dog changes its degrees at every occurrence of the stool changing. Picture the dog leaning at the exact degree the stool is at.		1294	-	kanji Lesson_9

Hold it while you sleep.	As you <kanji>hold</kanji> the temple you hear a voice. You look down through your fingers and see a tiny <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>).

The world is basically just a bunch of rice paddies smooshed together, if you think about it.	To get around this <kanji>world</kanji> of rice paddies, you need to use a <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>).	A rice paddy is mostly made up of water, just like our world, and you don't want to have wet feet. Use the power of your kayak to become a world traveler.		1296	-	kanji Lesson_9

We can’t leave the lantern inside of the tent; that’s a fire hazard. We’d best take it with us before the departure. Don’t you agree?	Feel the heat from the lantern. It’s not quite as comforting as being inside a tent, but it’s better than nothing. The lantern will light your way on your departure.	Oh! Don’t forget your <reading>hats</reading> (<ja>はつ</ja>) either. Wouldn’t want to start a <kanji>departure</kanji> without hats or a lantern. That’d be a short journey.	How cold and unprotected would your head be without a hat? Very. Taking hats along with departures is integral to their success. Imagine how unsafe you would feel with no hats.

Stand up straight, look the tree directly in its eye(s). If it looks right back, you know things are mutual.	It's the same with humans, you know? If you want to have a mutual relationship you need to be able to look each other in the eyes. If you're too embarrassed, or you look down on them, then that isn't mutual respect!	"If your respect for the tree is <kanji>mutual</kanji> with the respect the tree feels for you, you'll be able to see the tree's <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). Right now its soul looks pretty sad, like it's trying to say, ""Why are your people cutting down all my friends? I thought we had a mutual understanding."""

Oh, you're thinking of that big studio knock off. That's okay, whatever makes you remember the laws of prefectural rule.	This small lion's <kanji>prefecture</kanji> is being protected by <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>) the samurai because the lion is too small to protect all of this land himself.
