旦	Radical				Dawn	Dawn, Sunrise															The sun is coming up out of the ground, making this radical <radical>dawn</radical>. Of course, don't confuse this with dusk! You can do that by thinking that the sun is an optimistic and bright thing, so it tends to come up, not go down. (Also, Japan is the Land of the Rising Sun. I mean come on!)					3695	-	Lesson_24 radical
韋	Radical				Korea	Korea, Cow God															There are five mouths eating cow at <radical>Korea</radical>n BBQ. Korea is famous for their delicious BBQ, and you need a lot of people to eat all that beef. At least five people. (Get it? Five people!) That's why this radical is Korea.					3696	-	Lesson_24 radical
客	Radical				Guest	Guest															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>guest</radical>.					3697	-	Lesson_24 radical
制	Radical				Control	Control															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>control</radical>.					3698	-	Lesson_24 radical
然	Radical				Nature	Nature															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>nature</radical>.					3699	-	Lesson_24 radical

<i class=radical-death-star></i>	Radical				Death Star	Death Star															There is a hat covering the moon and it's holding a knife. Wait, that's no moon. It's a space station! It's the <radical>Death Star</radical>! It's pretending to be a moon under that hat. And it's armed! Don't let the Death Star stab your planet to death.					3701	-	Lesson_24 radical
担	Kanji	扌, 旦	Fingers, Dawn	radical, radical	Carry, Bear	Carry, Bear		<reading>たん</reading>	にな かつ			たん	にな, かつ								You use your <radical>fingers</radical> at <radical>dawn</radical> to <kanji>carry</kanji> many things. You have to carry yourself out of bed. You have to carry your backpack or purse or laptop bag to school or work. Your fingers have to carry a lot of weight around at dawn.	Think about your morning routine. You carry yourself into the bathroom and carry a toothbrush into your mouth. You carry your coat and bag out the door.	Once you're <kanji>carry</kanji>ing everything, and the dawn sun is shining bright, you start getting <reading>tan</reading> (<ja>たん</ja>). Especially those fingers you're using to carry things.	Picture yourself carrying a coat and a bag, walking through the rice fields to work, with the hot, dawn sun shining down, making your fingers get tanner and tanner.		3702	-	kanji Lesson_24
額	Kanji	客, 頁	Guest, Geoduck	radical, radical	Amount, Framed Picture, Forehead	Amount, Framed Picture, Forehead		<reading>がく</reading>	ひたい			がく	ひたい								This word has three really important meanings. It's probably best if you remember them all. Let's do this!  When you're a <radical>guest</radical> somewhere it's important to bring <radical>geoduck</radical>s. But more than that, the <kanji>amount</kanji> of geoducks you bring is really what matters. If you don't have any live geoducks go ahead and bring any amount of <kanji>framed picture</kanji>s of geoducks instead. If you can't even do that, well, then you're going to have to tattoo geoducks on your <kanji>forehead</kanji>.	If you're a guest you either have to have the right amount of geoducks, geoducks in framed pictures, or geoducks on your forehead. Otherwise you're a jerk.	Unfortunately, if you mess up any of these things, (the <kanji>amount</kanji>, the <kanji>framed picture</kanji>s, or the <kanji>forehead</kanji> tattoo) every other guest will <reading>gawk</reading> (<ja>がく</ja>) at you.	Feel the feel of hundreds of gawks. Feel ashamed as they gawk at you. How could you!?		3703	-	kanji Lesson_24
製	Kanji	制, 衣	Control, Clothes	radical, radical	Manufacture	Manufacture		<reading>せい</reading>				せい									In an attempt to <radical>control</radical> your <radical>clothes</radical>, you <kanji>manufacture</kanji> a mind control device. This mind control device will allow you to control the mind of your clothes and all that they do. You just need to manufacture it.	Imagine being able to control your clothes with your mind. What would you have them do? Imagine what you would do with your clothes if you could manufacture something to control them and move them around at will with your mind.	You <kanji>manufacture</kanji> these clothes to control your <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>). It's hard to manufacture, you have to do a lot of work, but you manage to make your clothes control your saber. Now you don't need to rely on your hands!	Now you're trying to manufacture a machine that will make sabers and clothes you can use to control them. Soon you'll have a manufactured army of saber-controlling clothes!		3704	-	kanji Lesson_24
違	Kanji	⻌, 韋	Scooter, Korea	radical, radical	Different	Different		い	<reading>ちが</reading>			ちが	い								You take your <radical>scooter</radical> to <radical>Korea</radical> and everything is <kanji>different</kanji>!	Imagine scooting down a street in Korea and seeing how different literally every single thing is compared to what you're used to in Japan.	What's also <kanji>different</kanji> is that there's a weird tiger bouncing on its tail alongside you yelling that its name is <reading>Tigger</reading> (<ja>ちが</ja>). You didn't know Tigger was living in Korea these days. That's definitely different.	Tigger is different in Korea too. For one, he's a white tiger now, and he's, like, really aggressive. Wait, was he always like that?		3705	-	kanji Lesson_24
輸	Kanji	車, <i class=radical-death-star></i>	Car, Death Star	radical, radical	Transport	Transport		<reading>ゆ</reading>				ゆ									What does a <radical>car</radical> and the <radical>Death Star</radical> have in common? They're both used to <kanji>transport</kanji> people and things.	Imagine stuffing a bunch of Stormtroopers in your car so you can transport them across the country. Well the Death Star can transport even more Stormtroopers, faster, and through space!	Right now you and the Death Star are <kanji>transport</kanji>ing <reading>yu</reading>rts (<ja>ゆ</ja>). They're the universe's #1 best transportable homes!	It's easy to transport a yurt even without a car or the Death Star.		3706	-	kanji Lesson_24
燃	Kanji	火, 然	Fire, Nature	radical, radical	Burn	Burn		<reading>ねん</reading>	も			ねん	も								<radical>Fire</radical> in <radical>nature</radical> will <kanji>burn</kanji> down everything in its path. In nature, there are no firefighters or anyone to contain the fire, so the fire will burn and burn until it has no fuel left to consume.	Feel the fire all around you as it burns. You’re out in nature – the middle of a forest fire. Hear the woods burn and crackle as you feel the heat around you.	What is the worst thing that could <kanji>burn</kanji> in this fire? Your <reading>nen</reading>doroid (<ja>ねん</ja>) collection. You've spent a lot of time and money collecting all these cool and rare and unique nendoroids and now they've all burned in the fire.	Cry your eyes out as you smell the smell of burning plastic from the nendoroids. Worst. Day. Ever.		3707	-	kanji Lesson_24
祝	Kanji	ネ, 兄	Spirit, Older Brother	radical, radical	Celebrate	Celebrate		<reading>しゅく</reading> <reading>しゅう</reading>	いわ			しゅく, しゅう	いわ								If a <radical>spirit</radical> blesses your <radical>older brother</radical> it's time to <kanji>celebrate</kanji>! This isn't something that happens every day to everyone's older brother. Yours is very good and very lucky. So celebrate with him!	Imagine what celebrating would be like. Imagine an older brother too, if you don't actually have one.	Unfortunately, the two of you <kanji>celebrate</kanji>d too much, and you went a little crazy. The spirit grabbed your brother and <reading>shook</reading> (<ja>しゅく</ja>) him. Shook him so hard his head popped off.	Never celebrate too hard. Otherwise you'll always have to think about the time a celebration spirit shook your brother till his head fell off.		3708	-	kanji Lesson_24
届	Kanji	尸, 由	Flag, Reason	radical, radical	Deliver	Deliver			<reading>とど</reading>			とど									The American <radical>flag</radical> is the <radical>reason</radical> you need to <kanji>deliver</kanji> this package. The flag is inside the package, and you need to deliver it to the president. He lost his old flag, so now it’s up to you to deliver this new one to him. What more of a reason do you need?	You need to deliver this flag to the president. Imagine yourself running as fast as you can while carrying the parcel in order to get it to him. Your lungs are tired and your legs burn, but you must deliver the flag as soon as possible!	To <kanji>deliver</kanji> this flag is something you just have <reading>to do</reading> (<ja>とど</ja>). Need to do. Want to do. There is no one else to do it. This is something only you are equipped to do.	The world depends on you to do this delivery. If you fail, the United States will be ruined. You have to do it! Deliver that flag now! Run! Run!		3709	-	kanji Lesson_24
狭	Kanji	犭, 夫, <i class=radical-horns></i>	Animal, Husband, Horns	radical, radical, radical	Narrow	Narrow		きょう	<reading>せま</reading> <reading>せば</reading>			せま, せば	きょう								You have an <radical>animal</radical> for a <radical>husband</radical> with <radical>horns</radical> that are <kanji>narrow</kanji>. This animal husband of yours is a goat. A goat with narrow horns. Why is this animal your husband? You’re weird, that’s why.	Imagine yourself married to this animal husband with horns that are narrow. It’s a strange marriage. Listen to the goat making its goat noises as it clomps around your home. Now hug your goat husband and feel its soft fluffy coat against your skin.	I’m not even going to get into the <reading>sema</reading>ntics (<ja>せま</ja>) of how this weird relationship of yours works. Nope, this reading explanation is on the straight and <kanji>narrow</kanji>. Need to know basis. Classified. All that junk. There will be no discussion of the semantics between you and your goat lover.	But that doesn’t mean you can’t imagine the semantics. The finer points of the relationship. Go ahead, imagine all the weird stuff that comes with the territory for having a goat as a husband. Use all that weird stuff to remember this kanji and its reading. Want an example? Just imagine the goat doing dishes! Goats don’t have hands! Hahahahaha!!		3710	-	kanji Lesson_24
肩	Kanji	戸, 月	Door, Moon	radical, radical	Shoulder	Shoulder		けん	<reading>かた</reading>			かた	けん								The <radical>door</radical> leading to the <radical>moon</radical> can be broken down with one’s <kanji>shoulder</kanji>. It’s not a very sturdy door to the moon, so it’s quite easy to drop your shoulder and ram it open.	Picture yourself smashing through this door using your shoulder and seeing the moon on the other side. Hear the splintering of wood as your shoulder crashes through the door and feel the impact with your body.	"""Wow, your <kanji>shoulder</kanji> is just like my <reading>cata</reading>pult (<ja>かた</ja>)!"" you hear someone shout. As you turn you're just in time to see a man catapulting through his own moon door!"	"Now the weird man is inspecting your shoulder really closely and he keeps muttering ""catapult powers"" under his breath. It's very unsettling, but he's kind of right. A shoulder works just like the mechanism that winds up a catapult."		3711	-	kanji Lesson_24
腕	Kanji	月, 宀, 夕, 巳	Moon, Roof, Evening, Snake	radical, radical, radical, radical	Arm	Arm		わん	<reading>うで</reading>			うで	わん								The <radical>moon</radical> shines on your <radical>roof</radical> in the <radical>evening</radical> and a <radical>snake</radical> suddenly appears! Wait, that's not a snake, it's your <kanji>arm</kanji>, sticking out from under the roof.	Arms really look like snakes in the moonlight. Picture it. Your arm is long and shiny, just like a snake.	Your <kanji>arm</kanji> is exposed to the moon and the outside and you feel a chill. Where are your clothes? Ah, you're n<reading>ude, eh</reading> (<ja>うで</ja>)?! I guess it is pretty common to sleep in the nude, eh?	Your arms are nude, eh? That's why they look like snakes, you know. You should be more careful.		3712	-	kanji Lesson_24
腰	Kanji	月, 覀, 女	Moon, Helicopter, Woman	radical, radical, radical	Waist	Waist		よう	<reading>こし</reading>			こし	よう								You're flying a <radical>helicopter</radical> and you see a <radical>woman</radical> in the <radical>moon</radical> light touching her <kanji>waist</kanji>. She has both hands on her waist, like she's Wonder Woman or something. But it's the middle of the night. What is she doing?	Imagine flying your helicopter closer to the woman, it's not so hard because you have lots of moon light to see in, and try to see why she's touching her waist.	As you get closer you realize her <kanji>waist</kanji> looks weird and... puffy? You bring the helicopter down and see that the woman's waist looks incredibly <reading>cozy</reading> (<ja>こし</ja>)! She has a blanket balled up and tied around her waist, she's holding it there with her hand, probably because it's cold out at night. But even with just her waist covered, she looks so warm and cozy! 	Imagine how cozy your waist would be if you tied a nice warm blanket around it.		3713	-	kanji Lesson_24
触	Kanji	角, 虫	Angle, Insect	radical, radical	Touch	Touch		<reading>しょく</reading>	さわ ふ			しょく	さわ, ふ								If, at a certain <radical>angle</radical>, you approach an <radical>insect</radical>, you’ll be able to <kanji>touch</kanji> it without it noticing. Most of the time, insects will run away from you when you try and touch them, but if you do so from the right angle, the insect will have no idea.	Imagine yourself approaching this insect from a sneaky and stealthy angle. Now touch it. What does it feel like? Smooth? Hard? Fuzzy? Feel the insect in your mind as you touch it.	Uh oh, looks like this particular insect is a lightning bug so when you <kanji>touch</kanji> it you get a <reading>shock</reading> (<ja>しょく</ja>). Did you know that lightning bugs contain bazillions of volts inside them? Well they do, and if you touch one, you get a shock. A very big shock.	Feel this electrical shock to your system as you touch the lightning bug. This discourages you from ever touching another insect again. You don’t enjoy the shock.		3714	-	kanji Lesson_24

It's basically the universal symbol of, ""We're watching you, and we'll publish what you do, so don't drive drunk."""	Open your newspaper in the morning and you can see what's been published about all the drunkards who didn't pay attention to the crosses on their cars. They were all arrested and their stories were published for all to see.	You need someone to <kanji>publish</kanji> all these stories, so you get your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>) to do it. It can keep an eye on all the drunkards cars through the special crosses you put on their cars. And the cyborg is a great editor, which is a plus.	Picture your cyborg, with one of those newsie hats on, publishing stories about all of the bad drunk drivers so they never do it again. It's using its metal and meat arms to publish multiple stories at once.		3715	-	kanji Lesson_24
層	Kanji	尸, 曽	Flag, Mask	radical, radical	Layer	Layer		<reading>そう</reading>				そう									Behind the <radical>flag</radical> lies a <radical>mask</radical>—yet another <kanji>layer</kanji> of secrecy. You’re standing in front of a crowd, giving a rousing speech. Hiding your face is the flag of your country, and behind that flag you’re also wearing a mask, just in case the flag falls down. The extra layer of secrecy is just to be safe.	These layers are meant to protect you. We all have layers we hide behind sometimes, you know? You can't be totally transparent with everyone.	Someone jumps up on stage and starts peeling off your <kanji>layer</kanji>s! You stand there, first goes the flag, then the mask, then ... your <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>) is laid bare. No, literally. You don't have a body, your soul was under that mask. And now it's floating there for all to see.	Everyone in the crowd is completely silent, staring at your soul, with all of its layers peeled off.		3716	-	kanji Lesson_24

You walk up to take the knife and lantern when you realize it's just a <kanji>model</kanji>. It all looked real from far away, but now that you're up close you can see none of it is real.	Why would anyone make a model that looks like a lantern and a knife sticking into the ground?	You touch the <kanji>model</kanji> and see that it's made of <reading>ca</reading>ke (<ja>けい</ja>)! Someone really into lanterns and knives must have been given this model cake as a birthday present! Though they left it out here so they probably didn't like it.	Haven't you seen any of those crazy cakes modeled after things like movies, towns, giants hams, and purses? They're all the rage. Next time you make a cake try to make it look like a model lantern and knife with fake cake dirt and everything.		3717	-	kanji Lesson_24

They're banding together right here in the street, making a new <kanji>government office</kanji>!	Imagine them putting together papers, talking to politicians, and standing in the street outside the capitol. They demand for this agency to be formed. They are doing all the correct, legal things to do it too.	"This new <kanji>agency</kanji> is just starting to make progress when you hear a low rumble... then a screech.  ""THIS IS MY STREET.

Look at it directly, because if you look away then it could disappear.	Look at the spirit. Look at its shape and into its eyes. Just don't look away.	You <kanji>look at</kanji> the spirit for as long as you can, until you hear a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) sound. You look away for a second, see the sheep look at you, and when you look back the spirit is gone. Damn!	Now you have to look at this sheep.

Now the king just looks like everyone else, there's nothing that sets him apart!	The king's distinction is gone. He isn't special, he isn't different. Without his horns he's like the rest of you plebs.	The king wants his <kanji>distinction</kanji> back so he runs down into the construction site just in time to see his horns getting cut into bits by a <reading>saw</reading> (<ja>さ</ja>).	I guess the construction worker couldn't distinguish between what he was supposed to saw and the king's horns. 		3720	-	kanji Lesson_24

It is pulling the bamboo off, because it wants to use it to make a long <kanji>pipe</kanji>.	Bamboo is great for pipes, and the only place for the bear to get it is your roof. So, that's why it's there.	The <kanji>pipe</kanji> will be for Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>), who would like some pipes for his house.	Watch the bear take away your bamboo.

But! This kanji has another meaning: <kanji>phenomenon</kanji>. If you were the first person to see an elephant, you'd call it that too.	"Picture the first Japanese person to see an elephant. He stops dead in his tracks, points and screams out, ""What a phenomenon!"""	<kanji>Elephant</kanji>s are great and all, except that when they die they turn into elephant <reading>zo</reading>mbies (<ja>ぞう</ja>). But you never see these zombies because the <reading>shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) has a special project in place that destroys all elephant bodies when they die.  Hint: The readings and meanings for this kanji match up really nicely. <ja>ぞう</ja> is always for elephant and <ja>しょう</ja> is always for phenomenon. Remember it like this, the elephant is the zombie and the shougun keeps everyone from finding out about this phenomenon.	Picture the shougun standing over a pit of zombie elephants. None of these are getting out on his watch, letting people believe in such crazy phenomenons.		3722	-	kanji Lesson_24

Picture dawn, the sun rising, the birds chirping, and the screams of a new born baby rise in the village. Or Maybe it's a new sheep! Or a new hat that someone just finished making.	Today's dawn has brought with it an increase in the <kanji>quantity</kanji> of <reading>row</reading> boats! Aww, aren't they cute? Look at all of the new row boats lined up together.

The boundary between your home and your neighbors. The boundary between your town and the next. All you have to do to see it is stand in the dirt. It also helps that there is a boundary sign standing in the dirt that you can also see.	Get off your computer and go stand outside in the dirt and see what boundaries you can see.	The <kanji>boundary</kanji> you're looking at is the <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょう</ja>) boundary.

The king also explains that this <kanji>loop</kanji> technique was used by Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) when he was conquering cities.

This stopping ceremony is being performed by the <kanji>military</kanji>. They'll march one direction, then stop and turn, then march another direction, then stop again.	The military really seems to have a thing for stopping a lot during their ceremonies.	You look closer at the people in the <kanji>military</kanji> and realize that every time they stop they take a drink of <reading>boo</reading>ze (<ja>ぶ</ja>)!	This is a ceremony for celebrating the military so I guess they can drink as much booze as they want, but this seems very strange to you.		3726	-	kanji Lesson_24

That seems like overkill, but it is necessary. These particular shellfish are of very high <kanji>quality</kanji> meaning they won't open so easily.	Imagine the highest quality shellfish you've ever seen. They're hard, smooth, and basically impenetrable.	You finally get all of the shellfish open and you're admiring their <kanji>quality</kanji>, when your <reading>shih tzu</reading> (<ja>しつ</ja>) jumps up on the table and gobbles them down. NO!

It seems like it's something important too, since they're sweating so much.	The angel just visited you, but it forgot to mention something important (probably life-threatening, it's an angel after all), and now you see it scooting at top speeds toward you.	"""I forgot to <kanji>mention</kanji>, you have to study nin<reading>jutsu</reading> (<ja>じゅつ</ja>)!"" the angel yells. But it's too late, there are ninjas jumping out of the bushes around you and taking you hostage."	The angel really should have mentioned ninjutsu earlier.

Sometimes you only have a few people playing blackjack so you don’t need to kick the flag at all, and sometimes  there are many people playing blackjack so you need to kick the flag many times in order to expand it to a proper size.	Imagine yourself kicking this flag to see the blackjack table expand. Feel your foot kicking the flag. You’ve kicked it so many times that your leg is sore, but you need to expand the table some more so you keep kicking it. Imagine the blackjack table making that sound Mario makes whenever he gets a mushroom and expands in size.	The blackjack table does have a limit though of how many times it will <kanji>expand</kanji>, and that limit is <reading>ten</reading> (<ja>てん</ja>). You can only kick the flag to get the table to expand ten times.	Imagine yourself kicking the flag ten times. Count it off in your head and imagine each instance up to ten. Any more kicks after ten don’t cause the table to do anything, but it does cause your leg to get sore.		3730	-	kanji Lesson_24
