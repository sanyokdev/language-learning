If you have your hands on either of these things, you'll be a rich duck.	Imagine yourself holding a king's hat covered in his hair. Who will you sell it to? This is such a rare item!	Then you look closer at the hat. It's about to get even <kanji>rare</kanji>r. Attached to the hair is the king's <reading>chin</reading> (<ja>ちん</ja>).	Not sure how it got there, but you'll make a pretty penny from this. The king only had one chin, so that's about as <kanji>rare</kanji> as they come.		6544	-	kanji Lesson_43

It doesn't matter if it's a yakuza member or not. Any knife will cause a split or tear in clothes.	"""I want to <kanji>split</kanji> and <kanji>tear</kanji> that.""

The Crabigator is a sea creature (maybe?), so making a tribute from shellfish makes some sense.	This great <kanji>tribute</kanji> is being commissioned by Emperor <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>. 	In his power, <ja>こういち</ja> has made a new religion around the Crabigator, to put the fear of kanji learning into his subjects.

You got the <kanji>gist</kanji>, but now there's the matter of this big <reading>chu</reading>te (<ja>しゅ</ja>).

As you watch, you get more of a gist of what's going on, but not all the way. Some people are throwing the stool down the chute, some people are sliding down it on their ears...

Going to Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょ</ja>) is a short <kanji>distance</kanji> for a giant but a long <kanji>distance</kanji> for you.

There were no cars yet, so they would hitch a cow to their bamboo plow, and dig their way to the government office or school to enroll.	Picture the little hut that passed for school long ago. All of the bamboo plows are parked around it, as the people enroll themselves and their kids up for classes.	If you <kanji>enroll</kanji> in something new people will find you very <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>). This was true long ago too. There's nothing sexier than trying to improve yourself.

You run along the <reading>ro</reading>ad (<ja>ろ</ja>), trying to get out of the rain, but the road keeps going and going, with walls on both sides.	You wonder how long this road will go.

It has to, though, because a cow's gotta eat.	It's cold outside (it's winter after all). Imagine you having to herd all the cows out to pasture even though they don't want to leave the warm barn.	"<ja>ぼく</ja> is one of the common ways to say ""I"" in Japanese (which you should remember!).

Voila! This is exactly how old <kanji>printing</kanji> presses used to work.	The old way of printing involved taking the pattern you want (the flag) pressing it against the place you want to print it (the towel) and then just slicing that sucker on there (with the knife).	"As you're working on <kanji>printing</kanji> your own flag onto this towel you look over and see someone else just <reading>sat</reading> (<ja>さつ</ja>) down on theirs.

That just means the ocean gets bigger when the moon's out, and that my friends is simply the <kanji>tide</kanji>.	The moon does affect the tides a bit, so you can imagine the tsunami as the water getting bigger whenever the moon is out. That's just the tide.	You go check out the <kanji>tide</kanji>. The water is coming in a little stronger, and something washes up on the shore. It's a body! You roll the body over and it is Mrs. <kanji>Chou</kanji> (<ja>ちょう</ja>)!

Back in the olden days, people had to make seals and draw out things by hand, so stamps came about so you can—BAM—just stamp it and have what you want in an instant.	Lots of things have roots from wanting to have something in an instant. Just think about instant ramen. The root of that was to get ramen real, real fast. Similar to stamps, ya know?	Think about the thing you want to make <kanji>instant</kanji>. I'd want instant <reading>sock</reading>s (<ja>そく</ja>)! Don't waste time searching for a matching pair or pulling them on.

At any other time of day, hedges tend to blend into their surroundings. But at dawn, the shadows the sun makes really helps them stand out.  This hedge also works as a <kanji>fence</kanji>. It borders an area and you can't walk through it. A natural fence!	Picture yourself leaning over a balcony at dawn, looking at all the hedges appear and their shadows stretch over the ground.	You're looking intently at one particular <kanji>hedge</kanji> because yesterday you dropped your <reading>ca</reading>r <reading>key</reading>s (<ja>かき</ja>) behind it. Now that you know where the hedge is you're going to need to search it to find your car keys.	Imagine rooting around under some hedges, desperately trying to find your car keys.

After you run into her <kanji>majesty</kanji>, her guardian <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) swoops on you and pulls you off of her.	Then it starts pecking at your eyes.

This is the way people used to seal things back in the day, back when we didn't have fancy things like tape and glue.	Picture sealing other things with dirt. Like the bricks in your wall. Or the hole in your floor. Dirt can seal in anything.	You can also <kanji>seal</kanji> <reading>foo</reading>d (<ja>ふう</ja>) in dirt to make it last longer. That's how jerky came about, you know. Seal some meat underground and in a few months you'll have some tasty dried meats to chew.  By the way, this has another reading you should probably know. It’s <ja>ほう</ja>. Most sealing is done in the <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>), you know? So just think about eating food in your own home!	Dig up your sealed food and eat it in the comfort of your own home.

As the hand <kanji>chafe</kanji>s on the trees, it says <reading>ma</reading>ma (<ja>ま</ja>), mama.	This is the hand of a child looking for its mama.

潜る	Vocabulary	潜	Conceal	kanji	To Pass Through, To Dive Underwater, To Go Underground, To Go Under	To Pass Through, To Dive Underwater, To Go Underground, To Go Under, To Get In, To Evade, To Pass Under					<reading>もぐる</reading> <reading>くぐる</reading>	もぐる, くぐる		Intransitive Verb, Godan Verb	モグラが土の下に潜って行くところを見ました。	I saw a mole going underground.	水の中にどのぐらいの間潜っていられますか。	How long can you stay underwater?	うちの犬は、フラフープをジャンプして潜る技を身につけました。	My dog learned a trick to jump through a hula hoop.	Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <kanji>conceal</kanji>, but as a verb, this word means <vocabulary>to go under</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to pass through</vocabulary>. Most commonly, this word means <vocabulary>to dive underwater</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to go underground</vocabulary>. Can you see why the kanji for conceal kind of makes sense in these cases? If you're underwater or underground, no one can see you!		潜る has two possible readings: <ja>もぐる</ja> and <ja>くぐる</ja>. The first is used when you mean to dive underwater or go underground.  The second is used when you pass through or under something, sometimes with difficulty, such as crawling under a fence. We want you to focus on <ja>もぐる</ja>, so here's a mnemonic to help you:  Why are you trying to dive underwater again and again?
