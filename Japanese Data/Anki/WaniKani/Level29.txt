It is your job to <kanji>oversee</kanji> everything they do."	You point to the gun. You point to the ground (that's where the gun goes). You point to the plate (you want it). You have to oversee everything the servant does.	Why must you <kanji>oversee</kanji> everything? Because you are Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>), and Genghis Khan oversees everything.	If anyone had to oversee a lot, it was Genghis Khan, who had one of the largest kingdoms in all of history.		4477	-	kanji Lesson_29
杯	Kanji	木, 不	Tree, Not	radical, radical	Cup Of Liquid, Counter For Cups	Cup Of Liquid, Counter For Cups		<reading>はい</reading>				はい									A <radical>tree</radical> is <radical>not</radical> a <kanji>cup of liquid</kanji> or a <kanji>counter for cups</kanji>. Don’t get them mixed up. The last time you tried making a cup out of a tree to count your throat got filled with splinters when you used it. There wasn't even any liquid in it.	Imagine cutting a tree into a cup of liquid and focus on the pain in your throat when you try to actually use it. Instead you kick the tree and angrily count cups of liquid in your head, because they simply are NOT the same.	Another way to remember the <kanji>counter for cups</kanji> using a <kanji>cup of liquid</kanji> would be by creating and memorizing a <reading>hai</reading>ku (<ja>はい</ja>) about them. Aren’t haikus useful?	Think of a haiku about a cup of liquid and a counter for cups. Use that haiku to help remember this kanji.		4478	-	kanji Lesson_29

Don't worry, there aren't bullets in the gun. It's an air gun! So just imagine shooting the air into your nose every morning to make sure it's nice and dry.	This technique for a nice <kanji>dry</kanji> nose was invented by Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>)! Well, not him, but someone who worked under him. You see, he had a bit of a damp nose problem.	Now the next time you manage to get your nose nice and dry, think back to our founding father Genghis Khan and thank him for where you are today.		4479	-	kanji Lesson_29

This same <kanji>sponsor</kanji> is also how you made your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>). You didn't think you were able to get all those body parts yourself, did you? No no, the leader of the mountain turkeys sponsored you so you could do your experiments.	"Turn your cyborg over and you'll see a stamp under one of its feet. It says, ""Sponsored by"" with a little picture of a turkey on top a mountain."		4480	-	kanji Lesson_29

As <kanji>urge</kanji>d, you put a <reading>sock</reading> (<ja>そく</ja>) on your foot. Ahh, that feels so much better. What a great thing, this sock.	Feel this sock on your foot. It feels great. Wiggle your toes around inside the sock as you think about how glad you are that you did as your leader urged.

欧	Kanji	区, 欠	District, Lack	radical, radical	Europe	Europe		<reading>おう</reading>				おう									A <radical>district</radical> that <radical>lack</radical>s things will be in <kanji>Europe</kanji>.	Picture a map of Europe in your mind. Now picture little words saying which district is lacking what. This one is lacking water. That one is lacking food.	<kanji>Europe</kanji> is lacking so much because their <ja><reading>王</reading></ja> (<ja>おう</ja>) keeps taking everything.	Okay, so maybe this is an old view of Europe. But back in the old days the <ja>王</ja>s there would take everything from their subjects, so every district would lack something. Good thing things aren't that way now, huh?		4482	-	kanji Lesson_29

Both the inlet and the bay were having a lot of construction done on them to repair the damage from the last tsunami, and then another tsunami rolled in and destroyed all that too. Bummer.	Picture all the construction on the bay and the inlet getting destroyed by the tsunami. Look at all of it fall apart and crash to the ground as the tsunami knocks it down. Imagine yourself right near the action, feeling the water spray from the tsunami.	Imagine the Japanese people standing on the <kanji>bay</kanji> and the <kanji>inlet</kanji> as the tsunami approaches. “<reading>Eh</reading> (<ja>え</ja>)? What is that, Akiko?” “Eh? Where? Oh gawd, it’s a tsunami!!”	EH? A tsunami you say? Those construction areas are screwed, man. Again, imagine the tsunami demolishing the area. Then be all like, “Eh? A tsunami?

You request a favor and the words slide out of your mouth in a bright, blue blob. They hover in front of you for a few seconds, before splashing onto the person you made the request to.	Picture this blue, slimy request. You could have done that thing by yourself, but you requested it of someone else, and now it's all over and everyone can see it.	The next time someone <kanji>request</kanji>s something from you, take out your <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>) and slice it in half!	Now they have the blue request gunk on them, and you can walk away as your already-blue sword absorbs the rest. Oh, and you don't have to fulfill the request (bonus!).		4484	-	kanji Lesson_29

These <kanji>male</kanji> animals are obviously experimenting with things still. Ah, they must be <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>)!  To be a youth, again!	It's just nature. Youths like to learn and try new things. And if two male youth animals wanna get together in private that's their business.		4485	-	kanji Lesson_29

Picture Korea first thing in the morning. You can see all the cities, the countryside, everything waking up.	"<kanji>Korea</kanji> is still here today on this beautiful morning because of Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>).

Oh, why did it have to break! If the net had been strong enough, your clothes wouldn't be even more dirty and lost down the river right now.	You angrily search to see what caused your clothes washing machine to <kanji>break</kanji> and you see some <reading>ka</reading>yaks (<ja>かい</ja>) upriver.

You just had the doctor <kanji>diagnose</kanji> you with hair loss. How terrible! You stumble out of the room, dumbfounded.

Sometimes if leaders aren't around all the time, people will get rebellious and act badly toward people who can get them in trouble. So when you mark them with charcoal you know that someone close with your leader is around and you should probably stop being a butt.	Imagine seeing one of the leader's colleagues walking around, watching you. You'd get back to work and stop goofing around, right?	You have to be good around her <kanji>colleague</kanji>s, because if you aren't your <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat permit will be taken away. Row boating is the only fun you ever get to have, besides learning kanji. So act as best you can around the leader's colleagues so you don't lose your row boat rights.

If the grains accumulate too much then they make more work for the farmers. If they accumulate too little, then they're starving the people. Ugh, grains just can't win with you people. They're blamed for everything.	Picture a pile of grains accumulating in size while a person watches. No matter how large the pile gets, the person keeps blaming them for something!	"Now the grains have <kanji>accumulate</kanji>d a ton, they're overflowing in their grain sacks, and the farmer freezes and says, ""Now those are some <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>) grains."""

Look up from the field or court and see the eye of your coach shining down and watching you closely. It makes you uncomfortable, honestly.	You finally win the big game and the <kanji>coach</kanji> is coming down off of his stool, and you see that's he's the ghost of <reading>Toku</reading>gawa (<ja>とく</ja>) Ieyasu!!!

As you imagine yourself giving a kiss to a rice paddy, think about whether or not the abbreviation RP would ever catch on. Do you think it would?	The rice paddy still refuses to accept this <kanji>abbreviation</kanji> despite your kisses. Therefore, you are forced to take the rice paddy and hang it from a torture <reading>rack</reading> (<ja>りゃく</ja>) until it agrees to accept the abbreviation.

You forget to put the lid back on the navigation station and all those tools and boat pieces go flying around the boat and into the water. Oops.	You watch the <kanji>navigation</kanji> equipment roll away and then you feel a slap on the back of your head. Ouch! You turn around and there stands <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>, who you took with you as the navigator of this expedition. And, you just lost all his stuff!

That being said, they are almost exactly the same, just the nuance is different.		"The reading isn't the same as <ja>訪ねる</ja>, though, I'm afraid.

When you finally remember, it's because you were looking down to think. It's to look at the toes of the giant Buddha statue. ""<reading>Oh Toes</reading>!"" (<ja>おとず</ja>) you exclaim."
