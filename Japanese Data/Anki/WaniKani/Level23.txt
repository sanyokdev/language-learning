Imagine being told to halt in front of your favorite restaurant, then being turned away. Noooo! Better start sucking up to the restaurant leader.	People only <kanji>halt</kanji> because they want this restaurant's world famous <reading>ta</reading>ter (<ja>てい</ja>) tots.

No wonder he can’t find employment.	Hear the strange sounds this drunkard is making. Let his ramblings enter your ears and imagine what he could be trying to say.	Since this guy is such a pathetic drunkard, it comes as no <reading>shock</reading> (<ja>しょく</ja>) that he can’t find <kanji>employment</kanji>. If he did find employment, I would be filled with both shock and awe.	Actually you find out that he does have employment. He’s a garbage man. Feel the shock of making this shocking discovery.

He’s pretty great. Imagine yourself shaking this husband’s hand because he’s so awesome.	It’s pretty <kanji>standard</kanji> for a husband and wife to exchange vows when getting married, and the husband said this girl held the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) to his heart. She unlocked the husband’s heart with the key and now he’s a man made whole.	Picture this woman actually sticking a physical key into the husband’s chest and turning it.

Even better than a guard dog they say. People are so confused by the turkey sitting on a stool holding flowers that they just lose their will to fight. This turkey is great to defend yourself and your home.	Picture this turkey holding its flowers while sitting on its stool. Hear it gobbling as it defends everything around it with its mere presence.	The only thing this flower-bearing turkey can't <kanji>defend</kanji> against is <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>). Godzilla is pretty much undefeatable, especially for a turkey.

As it <kanji>divide</kanji>s life, the mouth begins to look really familiar. It has big teeth and a crooked mustache... it's <reading>Wari</reading>o (<ja>わり</ja>)!  Sometimes Wario cuts himself by accident and just becomes <ja><reading>わ</reading></ja> (which is all he says too).	Picture Wario's mouth dividing himself now, and creating more, smaller Warios.

You’re tired from just climbing up the big mountain but the view is worth it. Feel the wind blustering around you as you take in the beautiful scenery, including the cape.	Atop the big mountain overlooking the <kanji>cape</kanji>, you see a <reading>saw</reading> and a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>さき</ja>) lying on the ground. What are they doing there?
