ユ	Radical				Hook	Hook															There's a flat line for where the hand was cut off. In it is a <radical>hook</radical> like a pirate might have. Yarrrr.					1078	-	Lesson_8 radical
巳	Radical				Snake	Snake															There's two ways to remember this one. First, you could look at this and see it's a coiled up <radical>snake</radical>. Or, if you want, you can imagine it as a snake head, with its face facing to the right (see its open mouth?). We may use either when learning a kanji, but for now you can pick the one that fits best with your memorization style. Just make sure you get to snake when you see this radical.  *Also note that sometimes the coil isn't totally completed (where it connects in the middle of the vertical line).					1079	-	Lesson_8 radical
云	Radical				Cloud	Cloud, Boobs															This is the radical for <radical>cloud</radical>. See how the cloud is puffy on the bottom but has two lines up top? That's because a plane flew through it. If humans didn't invent planes, this cloud radical might look different. Really makes you think, huh?					1080	-	Lesson_8 radical
殳	Radical				Weapon	Weapon, Ikea															Stick a table on top of a stool and you end up with a very dangerous <radical>weapon</radical>. Imagine hitting someone with this thing! Or, even better, imagine making someone sit on it. They'd be crushed mentally and emotionally and whatnot. Now that's a scary weapon.					1081	-	Lesson_8 radical
比	Radical				Compare	Compare															This radical is made up of two slightly different versions of the spoon radical (which you should already know). Look closely at these two spoons. <radical>Compare</radical> their differences. Like one of those magazines where you compare two similar pictures. But this time it's with spoons.					1082	-	Lesson_8 radical
罒	Radical				Net	Net, Sauron															This is a <radical>net</radical>, spread out over the water. Imagine all the fish you can catch in this net!					1083	-	Lesson_8 radical
釆	Radical				Sickle	Sickle															Most of this radical is just the rice radical, but the top part is something coming to cut the rice from its stalk. That, my friend, is the <radical>sickle</radical>. See how the rice is still there? That's because it's in motion. The sickle is literally doing the cutting RIGHT NOW! (And don't confuse this with the grain <ja>禾</ja> radical!)					1084	-	Lesson_8 radical
馬	Radical				Horse	Horse															Don't confuse this radical with the bird <ja>鳥</ja> radical. It looks similar, with the wing on the bottom and the shape on top, but it doesn't have a feather sticking out of the top of its head and it has a long, thick neck. So while it moves fast like it has wings, it's no bird, it's a <radical>horse</radical>.					1085	-	Lesson_8 radical
穴	Radical				Hole	Hole															You have a roof on top of what looks like a volcano. What is the roof covering on the top of the volcano? Why, it's definitely covering the <radical>hole</radical> at the top. I guess someone thought if they built a roof on the volcano hole, none of the lava could come out.					1086	-	Lesson_8 radical
易	Radical				Easy	Easy, Gravity															If you have wings, flying to the sun will be <radical>easy</radical>. If you try to get there with your wingless, human-body it will not be so easy.					1087	-	Lesson_8 radical
合	Radical				Suit	Suit															You find a hat on the ground with a mouth as the design on the front. You think it looks weird, but when you put it on, you find it <radical>suit</radical>s you quite well. Imagine yourself feeling not so sure about this hat at first. But, once you put it on, you feel pleasantly surprised.					1088	-	Lesson_8 radical
匚	Radical				Cage	Cage	Cape														This radical is a <radical>cage</radical> because it's covered on all sides but one (the one open side is where the cage door or gate is). There's nothing inside this cage because there's no gate, and whatever was inside has gotten out. I hope it wasn't rabid...					1089	-	Lesson_8 radical
<i class=radical-cape></i>	Radical				Cape	Cape, Cloak	Cage														This is a <radical>cape</radical>, like the kind a superhero would wear. See how it's hanging to the side? Imagine tying it around your neck and running around so it flies behind you.					1090	-	Lesson_8 radical
池	Kanji	也, 氵	Alligator, Tsunami	radical, radical	Pond	Pond		<reading>ち</reading>	いけ			ち	いけ								The poor <radical>alligator</radical> was taken far inland by a <radical>tsunami</radical>. Now his only source of water is a tiny <kanji>pond</kanji> that barely fits his body, and doesn't even provide much food.	Imagine the alligator riding the tsunami in. When he hits the ground, and the water recedes, he's all alone in a pond, but it doesn't provide much for him. Imagine him looking for food in the little, shallow pond. Imagine him trying to stay wet... it's just not a great situation to be in, unfortunately.	The worst part about this <kanji>pond</kanji> is that the only thing for the alligator to eat is <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>). Cheese may be yummy for humans, but alligators hate it. They'd rather eat the cow the cheese came from. Sadly, this pond is full of cheese.	Picture an alligator crying in a pond full of cheese. It's eating a piece really slowly and weeping.		1091	-	kanji Lesson_8
支	Kanji	支	Branch	radical	Support, Branch	Support, Branch		<reading>し</reading>	ささ			し	ささ								The <radical>branch</radical> radical and the <kanji>branch</kanji> kanji are the same! This kanji also means <kanji>support</kanji>. To remember it, think about a tree with lots of branches. The branches support each other and the trunk of the tree. If you were to climb the tree, the branches would be able to support your weight too!	Picture a branch supporting the weight of you, your entire family, and maybe a few friends.	You're happily sitting on this <kanji>branch</kanji>, letting it <kanji>support</kanji> all this weight, when a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) starts to climb the tree. A very, very big sheep. Uh oh... no no, sheep. If you get on this branch it won't be able to support all this weight!!!	"The big sheep walks up the side of the tree with its weird hooves and starts to put its weight on the branch. ""No no no!"" you and your whole family scream. The branch can't support the weight of the sheep. It snaps! You all tumble to the ground.  The end."		1092	-	kanji Lesson_8
住	Kanji	ｲ, 主	Leader, Master	radical, radical	Dwelling, Reside, Dwell	Dwelling, Reside, Dwell		<reading>じゅう</reading>	す			じゅう	す								The <radical>leader</radical> of the <radical>master</radical>s gets the biggest <kanji>dwelling</kanji>. He <kanji>reside</kanji>s in a huge mansion on the top of the mountain, surrounded by all the other masters in their smaller dwellings.	Picture the leader master's big, beautiful dwelling. Everyone else is jealous.	He needs this big <kanji>dwelling</kanji> so he has somewhere to store all of his <reading>jew</reading>els (<ja>じゅう</ja>). Masters always have lots of fancy, expensive things, and he has jewels.	Imagine opening the door to the leader master's dwelling and thousands of jewels come pouring out, whisking you off, down the mountain.		1093	-	kanji Lesson_8
助	Kanji	且, 力	Top Hat, Power	radical, radical	Help	Help		<reading>じょ</reading>	たす すけ			じょ	たす, すけ								With <radical>top hat</radical> <radical>power</radical>, you're able to <kanji>help</kanji> anyone.	Imagine putting on your top hat and getting power from it. Then, you use that power to help someone. It's important to make the association that it's the top hat giving you the power to help that person. You're basically Frosty the Snow Man.	The person you <kanji>help</kanji> with your top hat power? It's <reading>Jo</reading>-Anne (<ja>じょ</ja>).	You can imagine saving her however you like. Perhaps she was under a car, and you used your top hat powers to help her out of that situation by lifting it above your head.  Note: Jo-Anne is the character we're using with <ja>じょ</ja> reading mnemonics. She is short compared to Jourm (<ja>じょう</ja>), the giant farmhand, which is how you'll differentiate the two similar readings.		1094	-	kanji Lesson_8
医	Kanji	匚, 矢	Cage, Arrow	radical, radical	Medicine	Medicine		<reading>い</reading>				い									You're in a <radical>cage</radical> and you've been shot by an <radical>arrow</radical>. Obviously things are looking pretty bad. You need some <kanji>medicine</kanji> if you hope to live.	More specifically, antibiotics. Your wound is festering pretty badly.	"When we need to remember the sound <ja>い</ja> we use the word ""Eagle.""  You need your <kanji>medicine</kanji> really bad. Then, you look up. There's an <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) flying overhead. He has a package. It's medicine! You're saved!"	Or, so you think. He just keeps circling and circling. Feel some hate for the eagle. Why isn't he dropping the medicine? You don't have long to live!		1095	-	kanji Lesson_8
君	Kanji	ヨ, 丿, 口	Wolverine, Slide, Mouth	radical, radical, radical	Buddy	Buddy		<reading>くん</reading>	きみ			くん	きみ								"A <radical>wolverine</radical> is going down a <radical>slide</radical> into your <radical>mouth</radical>. Why is he going into your mouth, though? You're opening it really wide, because you're screaming ""<kanji>BUDDY</kanji>!!! You're so excited to see your wolverine buddy-pal again. You thought he was dead."	"Make sure you feel super happy. Even yell ""Buddy"" out loud while imagining this wolverine coming at you, if you're not in a quiet-zone."	As you're about to embrace your <kanji>buddy</kanji> wolverine, a rac<reading>coon</reading> tackles the wolverine off the slide, preventing your mouth embrace.	"""RaCCOON!"" you yell. ""THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. Get out of here."" Feel some hate for the raccoon. He ruined everything."		1096	-	kanji Lesson_8
対	Kanji	文, 寸	Writing, Measurement	radical, radical	Versus, Opposite	Versus, Opposite		<reading>たい</reading>				たい									You want to take a <radical>measurement</radical> of what you're <radical>writing</radical> to make sure it's long enough to hand in to your professor, when you realize it's the <kanji>opposite</kanji> of what you should be doing. You don't measure writing, you check things like word count and page numbers. Now it's going to be you <kanji>versus</kanji> the teacher on who determines how long this thing you're writing should be.	Okay. It's going to be you versus the teacher. Subject? Measuring physical length versus checking word count.	You let your nerves get the better of you and right when it's about to be you <kanji>versus</kanji> your professor, you hand him a new <reading>tie</reading> (<ja>たい</ja>). Is this also the <kanji>opposite</kanji> of what you should be doing? Probably, since it's bribery. But no one can say no to a tie, right?	"Next to your nicely measured writing, tape a brand new tie with a sticky note that says, ""I hope this isn't the opposite of what you want, because I really need this A."""		1097	-	kanji Lesson_8
局	Kanji	尸, <i class=radical-cape></i>, 口	Flag, Cape, Mouth	radical, radical, radical	Bureau, Department	Bureau, Department		<reading>きょく</reading>				きょく									"Your nation's <radical>flag</radical> sits on top of a <radical>cape</radical>d <radical>mouth</radical>. This is the symbol for the ""<kanji>Bureau</kanji> of Secret Things."" It's a special <kanji>department</kanji> of your government made to keep things hidden."	The cape covering the mouth represents how this bureau never talks about their secrets. The flag represents your country. Think about all the cool secret things the Bureau of Secret Things must have.	The <kanji>bureau</kanji>'s best-kept secret is cloaking devices that <reading>cloak you</reading> (<ja>きょく</ja>) with the press of a button.	Now, this mnemonic isn’t perfectly close, but the goal is to get you close enough in your brain so that you can remember <ja>きょく</ja> later. If you can get to CLOAK YOU, then you can get to <ja>きょく</ja> much easier than just trying to get there from scratch. So imagine working in this bureau and getting to cloak yourself all the time.		1098	-	kanji Lesson_8
役	Kanji	彳, 殳	Loiter, Weapon	radical, radical	Service, Duty	Service, Duty		<reading>やく</reading>				やく									You <radical>loiter</radical> around with a <radical>weapon</radical> because you're currently doing your <kanji>service</kanji> and <kanji>duty</kanji> to your country. You're standing guard outside, waiting just in case something will happen.	Imagine standing around with a weapon in your hands. It feels more like you're doing nothing, loitering around the wall, but this is how you offer your service to your country, so you have to do it.	"You're about halfway through your <kanji>service</kanji>, when a <reading>yak</reading> (<ja>やく</ja>) walks by. It stops directly in front of you and grunts. ""Excuse me, Mr. Yak, but it's my <kanji>duty</kanji> to escort you away from my country."""	Somehow your duty has become pushing this stubborn, hairy yak away from the entrance to your country. You poke it in the butt with your weapon, but it doesn't seem to care.		1099	-	kanji Lesson_8
投	Kanji	扌, 殳	Fingers, Weapon	radical, radical	Throw	Throw		<reading>とう</reading>	な			とう	な								In your <radical>fingers</radical> is a <radical>weapon</radical>, so you <kanji>throw</kanji> it. Maybe you're angry and you threw the weapon at a person you don't like. Maybe you're a pacifist and you threw it away so no one else could use it. Either way, when you have a weapon in your fingers you have to throw it.	Imagine a weapon in between your fingers. It doesn't matter what kind. Now feel the weight as you throw it.	You <kanji>throw</kanji> your weapon away because you're about to enter <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja> and there are no weapons allowed there. There is, however, a big pile of thrown away weapons by the border, which is where you're throwing yours right now.

Which weapon will you choose. <kanji>Decide</kanji> now!	Have trouble with the decision. Which one? Tsunami will be big and cool, but a hook will be more discreet. How can you decide? Can you think of a neat way to decide this, like Two-Face on Batman?	"To remember the reading <ja>けつ</ja> we always use the word ""ketsup."" It's a special mix of ketchup and catsup (yum!)  You finally <kanji>decide</kanji>. You're going to go with the tsunami... but not just any tsunami. You'll kill him with a tsunami of <reading>ketsu</reading>p (<ja>けつ</ja>)."

You should always do research with nine variables so you can compare them and so there's an uneven number.	Imagine carefully digging nine holes so you can do your research. Hmm, I wonder what kind of research these holes are for...	You are <kanji>research</kanji>ing <reading>cu</reading>cumbers (<ja>きゅう</ja>)!	Put nine full grown cucumbers into their holes so you can research what happens next.		1102	-	kanji Lesson_8
身	Kanji	自, 丿	Self, Slide	radical, radical	Somebody, Someone, Body	Somebody, Someone, Body		<reading>しん</reading>	み			しん	み								The self radical is a bit modified, with things sticking out, but that’s because it’s falling down a slide.  Sure, it’s your<radical>self</radical> who’s tumbling down the <radical>slide</radical>… at least that’s how it feels to you. Who are you? What are you? All you know is you’re <kanji>somebody</kanji>, but you don’t know who that somebody is.	Apparently, you’re having some kind of internal crisis. Come up with a rough one and you’ll remember this kanji better.	You’re falling down this metaphorical slide… And then you hit something… and you hit it really hard. It’s your metaphorical <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>). You split it in half and it’s at a right angle. The pain is incredible (shins have a lot of nerves!). It may have been broken, and you may not be able to walk correctly again… metaphorically speaking, that is.	Just make the tumble and shin hit as painful as possible in your imagination and you’ll surely remember this kanji’s on’yomi.		1103	-	kanji Lesson_8

When dead bodies are out in the sun like this, they really begin to decompose. You are wondering who this person is, though. You can't tell because it's fallen apart too much. You look on the coffin. There's a label, but it only says ""<kanji>someone</kanji>."""	"Smell the stench of the decomposing body. Also, feel really curious as to who this person is. It came from somewhere that gives you a reason to believe it's someone you know. Then, feel the disappointment as you read the label that says ""someone"" instead of an actual name.

It's a <reading>sha</reading>man (<ja>しゃ</ja>), dressed in full shaman garb."	How strange that a shaman was delivered to you this way!

研	Kanji	石, 开	Stone, Lantern	radical, radical	Sharpen	Sharpen	Shape	<reading>けん</reading>	と			けん	と								A <radical>stone</radical> <radical>lantern</radical> is an excellent way to <kanji>sharpen</kanji> anything, even in the dark. Your knives, your forks, your spoons, and even your sword.	Imagine walking around at night and you need to sharpen your sword. You walk up to a stone lantern and rub your sword all over it to sharpen it. Touch the blade. Indeed, it's been sharpened!	Why did you <kanji>sharpen</kanji> your blade? Because you are about to do battle with <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>), the famous samurai warrior.	You'll want to remember this character, because he will come up many times throughout your WaniKani journey. Ken the samurai used to work for WaniKani, but then he went rogue because he thought WaniKani wasn't being radical enough. So now he wanders the website carrying his squid friend (who you'll meet later) in a bucket.  To help you visualize him, imagine a samurai with armor made from crab shells, a helmet that is just an alligator head, and swords with crab claw hand guards. His great beard and mustache are styled in the shape of whatever kanji is giving you the most trouble at the time.		1105	-	kanji Lesson_8
馬	Kanji	馬	Horse	radical	Horse	Horse		<reading>ば</reading>	うま			ば	うま								The <radical>horse</radical> radical and the <kanji>horse</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Huzzah!		"You are looking at a horse. It's looking at you. You try making horse noises at it, to get a reaction. Instead of reacting with a normal horse noise, it just makes sheep noises: ""<reading>Baaa</reading>,"" (<ja>ば</ja>) it says. ""Baaaaa."""	Feel the shock of this.

Just based off this, you should be able to figure it out. This kanji means ""<kanji>forest</kanji>."""	Makes sense, because a bunch of individual trees is what makes up a forest!	One tree? No. Two trees? Not enough. I want <reading>more</reading> (<ja>もり</ja>) trees, please!	"Keep repeating this pattern over and over, continually focusing in on how you need ""more"" trees to make this forest.

If you know that, you can go from <kanji>place</kanji> to place.	Imagine looking at the dirt. It's a distinct color and texture, and you're able to identify your location just from that alone.	Knowing your <kanji>location</kanji> from dirt is quite a feat! Who taught you that? It was <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>), the big local farmhand. Despite being a bit weird, he does really know his dirt and can tell you the <kanji>place</kanji> from which any dirt came.	Remember Jourm?

The <radical>moon</radical> is off to the right. That's because it's the <kanji>morning</kanji>, which is when the sun and moon switch over. Those crosses are making sure the sun stays high in the sky for the rest of the day.	Imagine a sun attached up in the sky with two crosses, which act as scaffolding, and the moon gradually fading off to the right as the morning wears on.	Every <kanji>morning</kanji> you have <reading>Asa</reading>hi (<ja>あさ</ja>) beer for breakfast.

This kanji also means <kanji>number in a series</kanji>, which is a lot like a turn. For example, you're number 3, so your turn will be number 3.	"Go through in your mind the system your farm / village uses for deciding who has to sickle on any given day. It rotates, and it's a turn-based system. So, do you all stand in a line? Is there a calendar? Come up with something interesting, focusing on your turn in the process you come up with.    It will be helpful to remember both the ""number in a series"" and ""turn"" meanings for the vocab coming up in the future."	This <kanji>turn</kanji>-based rice sickle system is a contest as well! But, you are disappointed to find out that you have been <reading>ban</reading>ned from the game because of the performance enhancing steroids you've been taking.	Try to feel disappointed by this.

There is an <kanji>interval of time</kanji> in the sense that the sun goes through it at the same time every day. And there is an <kanji>interval of space</kanji> in the sense that it has to go through the space between the gate posts.

Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. <ja>間</ja> has two common kun'yomi readings, <ja>あいだ</ja> and <ja>ま</ja>. You haven't learned these readings yet, so here's an explanation of each reading and mnemonics to help you remember them:   When <ja>間</ja> refers to a longer interval of time, it's generally read as <ja>あいだ</ja>. For a short burst of time, it's read as <ja>ま</ja>. When it means an interval of space, it's usually read as <ja>あいだ</ja>.   You can remember this because time feels longer in <reading>Ida</reading>ho (<ja>あいだ</ja>). Any interval of time you spend there feels so long, because Idaho life moves so slowly. As soon as you cross the border and enter a new state, you call your ma (<ja>ま</ja>) to tell her you're finally out of that slooooow state, and the intervals of time feel shorter.

The <kanji>South</kanji> <kanji>mouth</kanji> isn't actually a mouth you find in the south pole or anything, it's an entrance or exit.

It means both <vocabulary>South exit</vocabulary> and <vocabulary>South entrance</vocabulary>.		The reading for these kanji are both kun'yomi.
