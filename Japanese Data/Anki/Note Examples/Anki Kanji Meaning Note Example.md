## Meaning Mnemonic:
> ```html
>You offer a <radical>hot pepper</radical> to the <radical>king</radical>, and he gives you a <radical>drop</radical> of something. You look down at the drop to see it transforming into a <kanji>disc</kanji>. And not just any old disc at that. It's a <kanji>jade disc</kanji>.
>
>Have you ever seen ancient Chinese jade discs with holes in the middle? That's what this kanji is referring to.
>
>You took a long time to pick out the perfect hot pepper. Only the best for the king, right? It burned your hands a little as you held it on your way to the palace. You were hoping for something pretty special in return, but you never imagined it would be a drop that magically turns into a disc. Wow!
