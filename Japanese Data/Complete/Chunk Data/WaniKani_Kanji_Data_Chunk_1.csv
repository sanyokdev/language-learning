- Hint: It gets kind of weird when you know their names... Usually you just make them into tea without knowing who they are (easier that way). This one... this one is Chad, and you remember it vividly, because now you feel kind of bad."

Wow!"	<reading><jp>へき</jp></reading>	<jp>たま</jp>	None	へき	"Wait, did a drop really just change into a <kanji>disc</kanji>? What the <reading>heck i</reading>s (<jp>へき</jp>) going on?<br><br>

- Hint: Feel the happiness that the leader would feel at this revelation. It will make everything much more convenient for her, since she's not the one doing all the manual labor. She won't have to eat out of a bento, that's for sure."
5	社	Company	Spirit,Dirt	ネ,土	"Plant a <radical>spirit</radical> in the <radical>dirt</radical> before you start your <kanji>company</kanji> and it will be successful.

- Hint: Imagine being so surprised by this arrow. Then, think of all the things you know that need to be said and told to everyone. Maybe you have information about nuke codes.

One of the things you <kanji>know</kanji> is actually very strange but very important. The president's <reading>chee</reading>se (<jp>ち</jp>) has been poisoned and only you know. If you could just say something then maybe you could save her... but... you have an arrow in your mouth.<br><br>

You keep digging and digging around it, but it's huge. Turns out, you found yourself a <reading>car</reading> (<jp>か</jp>). Keep digging until you unearth the car. Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.<br><br>

- Hint: There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is <jp>げ</jp>, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read <jp>下</jp> as <jp>げ</jp>. That's the problem with really common kanji - too many readings."
33	股	Crotch,Groin,Fork	Moon,Weapon	月,殳	"You keep your <radical>moon</radical> <radical>weapon</radical> in your <kanji>crotch</kanji>. Where else would you keep it?<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine how angry you were about the policy. You'll have to come up with something to be angry about yourself (pick something that would actually make you angry, like maybe you're only allowed to wear cut off short-shorts jeans at Nintendo now), but if you pick something good, you'll definitely remember the two readings for this. Just remember you're working at <reading>Nin</reading>tendo, and the policy has to be something about <reading>jean</reading>s.

44	梨	Pear	Grain,Knife,Tree	禾,刂,木	"The <radical>grain</radical> you cut off a <radical>tree</radical> with a <radical>knife</radical> is a <kanji>pear</kanji>. I don't know if you've ever seen Asian pears, but they're pretty big and sturdy. You can't just pick them off of the tree, you need the help of a knife. That's why this is a pear, and not an apple or peach or something else.<br><br>

This kanji has another meaning too. The leader can't come to the ceremony because they forgot what <kanji>period</kanji> of time it was. If they think they're in the wrong <kanji>age</kanji>, they won't come because they're trying to lead some monkeys in the ceremony instead.<br><br>

To make this more stuff, like drawers and such, you need more wood, and wood comes from trees. Add materials from the tree to the table and you have a desk.<br><br>

39	埋	Bury	Dirt,Village	土,里	"The <radical>dirt</radical> next to your <radical>village</radical> is where you <kanji>bury</kanji> the dead. People don't live forever, so every village has a patch of dirt specifically used for burying dead things.<br><br>

There is an <kanji>interval of time</kanji> in the sense that the sun goes through it at the same time every day. And there is an <kanji>interval of space</kanji> in the sense that it has to go through the space between the gate posts.<br><br>

- Hint: ""Interval"" is a weird word to remember, but just think of the sun going around the earth and through the gate like clockwork. Every 24 hours it passes through the gate, and each interval is exactly the same."	<reading><jp>かん, けん</jp></reading>	<jp>あいだ, ま</jp>	None	かん, けん	"This method of keeping track of <kanji>interval</kanji>s of time was invented by the great Khans of Mongolia, specifically the most famous Khan of all: Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<jp>かん</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Picture Genghis Khan ordering his most skilled inventors and builders to create this special sun gate so they can harness the power of intervals, and all people under his rule can benefit from the accurate telling of time."
3	今	Now	Now	今	"The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>now</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>now</kanji> as well.<br><br>

- Hint: Make sure you know those radicals, yo!"	<reading><jp>こん</jp></reading>	<jp>いま</jp>	None	こん	"Right <kanji>now</kanji> the <reading>con</reading>dors (<jp>こん</jp>) are in danger!

3	切	Cut	Seven,Sword	七,刀	"If you have <radical>seven</radical> <radical>swords</radical>, there's only so much you can do with them. The main thing? Probably using them to <kanji>cut</kanji> something.<br><br>

You <kanji>cut</kanji> them into pairs, and give <reading>sets</reading> (<jp>せつ</jp>) to everyone who needs them in the village.<br><br>

- Hint: Just make sure you think about how you need to give them away in <reading>sets</reading>, and not anything else. This is the most important thing to think about in your head as you're trying to establish the mnemonic for your kanji reading memory. It's gotta be sets."
3	分	Part,Minute,Separate,Understand	Fins,Sword	ハ,刀	"The <radical>fins</radical> that fell onto my <radical>sword</radical> were sliced into two <kanji>parts</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: The logic of this story makes a lot of sense - even in the kanji itself the fins are falling onto the sword from above. What happens to things that fall onto swords? They become more than one <kanji>part</kanji>."	<reading><jp>ぶん, ふん, ぶ</jp></reading>	<jp>わ</jp>	None	ぶん, ふん, ぶ	"Now that you've cut the fish, it's time to cut something else into <kanji>parts</kanji>. Next on your list is the <reading>buns</reading> (<jp>ぶん</jp>) which need to be split up amongst the people.

- Hint: Think about the <reading>buns</reading> (<jp>ぶん</jp>) as absolutely delicious things you want to eat really bad. If you want to eat the buns, and you taste the buns in your imagination, you'll surely remember that the reading for this kanji is <jp>ふん</jp> as well."

He's <kanji>inside</kanji> there, doing evil things."	<reading><jp>ない</jp></reading>	<jp>うち</jp>	None	ない	"You know this kanji means inside, so you can keep thinking about the person that’s inside you, running around. You finally discover him, and try to take him out, but before you can, he pulls out a <reading>kni</reading>fe (<jp>ない</jp>) and threatens to cut you if you do anything irrational.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine him holding the knife out, threatening to stab your brain. You’re in a conundrum here. If you don’t take him out, you’re in trouble, but if you do try to take him out, he might stab you in the brain with his knife. Try to think a way around this situation, focusing mainly on his knife."

All people are the same. There are thousands of <reading><jp>こう</jp></reading>s walking around, and they all stare at you (though they pretend like they aren't).<br><br>

- Hint: Remember, whenever we see the reading <jp>こう</jp>, think of <jp>こういち</jp>, a founder of WaniKani. We'll keep it consistent, so over time you should develop a character around <jp>こういち</jp> that you learn to love or hate.<br><br>

- Hint: How long have you been hiding in private with your fins? The public areas have changed, and all the people have become <jp>こういち</jp>s. One mother <jp>こういち</jp>--pushing a baby <jp>こういち</jp>--looks up and stares at your fins. Now you remember why you never go out in public."

This isn't a tree made of pie, or growing fully-baked pies. It's a pi tree, one that exists infinitely. It's the most rare tree in the world. And if you want to stick your fingers in it, you have to <kanji>search for</kanji> it far and wide!<br><br>

You can't search for anything inside, and you definitely can't find the pi tree inside, so you spend a lot of time outside in the bright sun.<br><br>

- Hint: Feel the sun's rays on your skin as you search and search and search for the tree. Watch as your skin gets darker, crispier, and hmm, smells like cooked meats. Now that's a good tan."

- Hint: To help this mnemonic along, literally imagine your older brother as someone that's just a giant mouth with a pair of legs walking around. It talks and talks and talks, too, irritating you. Feel the irritation specifically at your older brother. He's older than you, so you can't beat him up... yet."	<reading><jp>きょう, けい</jp></reading>	<jp>あに, にい</jp>	None	きょう, けい	"You wish you could box your loud-mouth <kanji>older brother</kanji> up and send him far away to <reading><jp>きょう</jp></reading>. <jp>きょうと</jp> is super far away from where you currently live, so just ship your older bro off so he can never bother you again.<br><br>

So quick that you probably won't even know the wind did it. You'll end up standing up again just to be knocked over again, just as quick.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine how quick the wind knocks you over when you stand up. So quick, you don't even remember being up. Try again and try to count how many seconds it takes for it to knock you down.

12	島	Island	Bird,Mountain	鳥,山	"A <radical>bird</radical> sits upon a <radical>mountain</radical>. If you look at the radicals, the bird is quite large and the mountain quite small. Think of this in the mnemonic as well. The reason the mountain is small is because you can only see the top of it, sticking out of the water. On it is the bird. This small mountain with the bird on it is an <kanji>island</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the mountain as small as you'd like. Maybe it's only barely sticking out of the sea, and the bird is having trouble standing on it. Whatever you do, make sure you think of it as an island, possibly owned by the bird."	<jp>とう</jp>	<reading><jp>しま</jp></reading>	None	しま	"But this <kanji>island</kanji> doesn't only belong to the bird. In fact, the bird shouldn't be on this island, because it belongs to the <reading>She</reading>ep <reading>Ma</reading>ma (<jp>しま</jp>), who is like Mother Nature but for sheep. The all-powerful Sheep Mama comes to kick the bird off the island, because this place is only for sheep! All hail the Sheep Mama.<br><br>

As long as you feel disconcerted that the leader isn’t tall enough, you should be able to remember that you need to attach something to the leader to make them tall enough.

- Hint: Remember Jourm? He's our local farmhand who only has nine toes (from the <jp>上</jp> mnemonic). Imagine that guy explaining to you how to know your location from dirt. He may be a bit clumsy, but the man really does know his dirt."

The <kanji>sun</kanji> is so hot. It focused its rays to take out one man... and that man is Friedrich <reading>Nietzsche</reading> (<jp>にち</jp>), famous philosopher. He philosophized one too many things about the sun, so the sun decided it was time he paid.<br><br>

- Hint: This reading will be easier to remember if you know of Friedrich Nietzsche... so do your research and learn about him if you don't. He's a pretty historical dude.

- Hint: To remember the meaning of <kanji>One</kanji>, imagine yourself there at the scene of the crime. You grab <kanji>One</kanji> in your arms, trying to prop it up, trying to hear its last words.

- Hint: Make sure you feel the ridiculously <reading>itchy</reading> sensation covering your body. It climbs from your hands, where you're holding the number <kanji>One</kanji> up, and then goes through your arms, crawls up your neck, goes down your body, and then covers everything. It becomes uncontrollable, and you're scratching everywhere, writhing on the ground.

Go ahead and try to calculate what that would come out to. It's not that expensive, actually.<br><br>

- Hint: But, the problem is even though you have a <kanji>thousand</kanji> <reading>cents</reading> in your pocket, you can't get them out. You're stuck under all these crosses.

4	世	World,Generation	World	世	"The <radical>world</radical> radical and the <kanji>world</kanji> kanji are the same, but there is another really important meaning you need to know: <kanji>generation</kanji>. <br><br>

Think of it this way: the world is just made up of many different generations of people, plants, and animals all getting along together.<br><br>

- Hint: It's all these generational differences that make the world go 'round!"	<reading><jp>せ, せい</jp></reading>	<jp>よ</jp>	None	せ, せい	"It's your job to protect the <kanji>world</kanji> and every <kanji>generation</kanji> with your special <reading>sa</reading>ber (<jp>せい</jp>). It was given to you to uphold correctness, and you'll pass it on to the next generation when it's time. Then they'll watch out for the world when you're gone.<br><br>

- Hint: Hold the saber up high and pledge to protect the world for all of the generations to come! Then swish it around and make buzzing sounds with your mouth."
5	西	West	West	西	"The <radical>west</radical> radical and the <kanji>west</kanji> kanji are the same. Isn't that nice?<br><br>

- Hint: Make sure you know all those radicals, will make your life more pleasant."	<reading><jp>せい, さい</jp></reading>	<jp>にし</jp>	None	せい, さい	"People are attacking from the <kanji>West</kanji>, so you pull out your <reading>sa</reading>ber (<jp>せい</jp>) and beat them back. You keep pushing further and further West until you reach the ocean and there's nowhere left for them to run.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture yourself fighting your way West, your saber shining in the light of the sun as it sets in front of you. You'll protect your home from the West if it takes everything you and your saber have left!"
1	口	Mouth	Mouth	口	"The <radical>mouth</radical> radical and the <kanji>mouth</kanji> kanji are exactly the same!<br><br>

- Hint: If you learned your radicals–which the WaniKani system forces you to do (unless you're cheating)–you'll already know the meaning of the kanji."	<reading><jp>こう, く</jp></reading>	<jp>くち</jp>	None	こう, く	"Do you remember seeing the construction worker <jp>こういち</jp> earlier in the <jp>工</jp> mnemonic? If you haven't yet, not to worry! 
For kanji with <jp>こう</jp> readings (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character <jp>こういち</jp> every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see <jp>こう</jp>, think <jp>こういち</jp>.<br><br>

Everyone agrees, (<reading><span lang=""ja"">こう</span></reading><jp>いち</jp>)'s <kanji>mouth</kanji> is his best feature. You stare at it lovingly as he whispers sweet kanji readings to you.<br><br>

- Hint: You just can't forget all the cool things about kanji learning he said from that mouth. What a great mouth <jp>こういち</jp> has. How are the lips of his mouth both so skinny and fat at the same time?"
4	花	Flower	Flowers,Leader,Spoon	艹,ｲ,匕	"A <radical>leader</radical> with a <radical>spoon</radical> is planting <radical>flowers</radical> so that one day this place may be full of beautiful <kanji>flower</kanji>s.<br><br>

- Hint: It's kind of weird that the flowers radical is only a part of the flower kanji, but you'll make do. Just focus on the fact that the leader is planting all these flowers for a bigger picture thing (that's what leaders do). He wants there to be flowers for future generations as well, because he's a nice dude like that."	<jp>か, け</jp>	<reading><jp>はな</jp></reading>	None	はな	"The leader can't stop planting <kanji>flower</kanji>s though. He's going crazy. Maybe it's the pollen? He comes up to someone named <reading>Hannah</reading> (<jp>はな</jp>) and starts planting flowers in her face, probably killing her in the process.<br><br>

- Hint: Do you know anyone named Hannah? Any famous people, perhaps? Try to come up with someone you know of named Hannah that you can imagine to be in this mnemonic, to help you remember it better."
4	名	Name,Famous	Evening,Mouth	夕,口	"What is the <radical>evening</radical> <radical>mouth</radical>? Imagine a mouth that’s up in the night sky. It’s just there, talking, and only comes out at night. It only appears in one area of the world (what area would you choose? Imagine yourself going to that place to see the “night mouth.”), and appears only one month out of the year (more on this in a second). The “evening mouth” is the most famous thing in the _____ area (this is the area you choose). He’s so <kanji>famous</kanji> that everybody knows his <kanji>name</kanji> (“Evening Mouth.”).<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine yourself going to the area you chose, and watching “Evening Mouth” speak. There are thousands of others there, wanting to see the giant floating mouth in the night sky. “Evening Mouth” then says “Everyone, what’s my <kanji>name</kanji>!?” and everyone shouts back “Evening Mouth!” in unison. “Evening Mouth” has certainly gotten really <kanji>famous</kanji>."	<reading><jp>めい, みょう</jp></reading>	<jp>な</jp>	None	めい, みょう	"So, when does “Evening Mouth” appear? Turns out, “Evening Mouth” only comes out to talk in <reading>May</reading> (<jp>めい</jp>). You know this because it’s just starting to be spring, and when you look around (you’re watching “Evening Mouth” again) you see some spring flowers come up.<br><br>

- Hint: You know what they say. April showers bring May Flowers. What do <reading>May</reading> Flowers bring? They bring “Evening Mouth,” baby."
4	年	Year	Gun,Cow	"<i class=""radical-gun""></i>,牛"	"The <radical>cow</radical> part of this kanji is slightly altered, but I think you can see where it is. The <radical>gun</radical> looks just fine, though. Think back to a fake memory you have living on the farm. You have your gun, and you gotta use it on a cow (ruh roh). Once a <kanji>year</kanji> on New Year's, you have to go out and shoot one of the cows. It's only a yearly shooting, though, so at least there's that respite.<br><br>

- Hint: You'll have to imagine yourself doing this to remember the meaning of the kanji. Focus on the thought that ""okay... it's only once a year... I only have to do this once a <kanji>year</kanji>..."""	<reading><jp>ねん</jp></reading>	<jp>とし</jp>	None	ねん	"It is New <kanji>Years</kanji>, though, so when you bring the dead cow back home, it’s time to celebrate. Using the cow’s organs and bones, you and your siblings construct a <reading>nen</reading>doroid (<jp>ねん</jp>). Nendoroids are Japanese toys - little plastic figurines (Google it if need be). You make a little cow nendoroid holding a gun. How cute.<br><br>

- Hint: How funny that you use dead cow parts to make a miniature cow holding a gun much like the one you murdered earlier. Imagine yourself playing with this nendoroid as you think about how weird it was to make a cow nendoroid out of a dead cow."
2	出	Exit	Mountain	山	"There are two <radical>mountains</radical> in front of you... and probably a bunch more around you too. You are in a pass, and don't know how to get out. You are frantically looking for the <kanji>exit</kanji> before you freeze to death. The most important thing is to find the exit from this mountain range - your life depends on it.<br><br>

- Hint: In your imagination, really feel like your life depends on getting out. The important part is the feeling of ""needing to get out of the mountain pass."" If you have this feeling, you'll be more likely to remember that this kanji means exit, because that's what you want to do when you see this kanji."	<reading><jp>しゅつ</jp></reading>	<jp>で, だ</jp>	None	しゅつ	"As you're trying to <kanji>exit</kanji> this mountain range, you suddenly realize that someone is actually hunting you. What? Make sure to feel that sudden realization. It's crazy. Then, you find the exit and run towards it. Sadly, the hunter is waiting there, and he <reading>shoots you</reading> (<jp>しゅつ</jp>) through the leg, knocking you down.<br><br>

- Hint: Focus on the surprise of realizing you're being hunted while trying to find the exit to the mountain range, then focus on the next part, where you get shot. View it in your head as the hunter shooting you. Powww!"
4	足	Foot,Leg,Sufficient	Foot	足	"The radical for <radical>foot</radical> and the kanji for <kanji>foot</kanji> are exactly the same.<br><br>

That being said, there's also another meaning you should keep in mind, which is <kanji>sufficient</kanji>. If you think about it, one foot should be <kanji>sufficient</kanji> enough to walk around with if you hop.<br><br>

- Hint: Same kanjis and radicals make Jack a happy boy. You should also learn the other meaning as well, though, if you can."	<reading><jp>そく</jp></reading>	<jp>あし, た</jp>	None	そく	"What do you wear on your <kanji>foot</kanji>? You wear a <reading>sock</reading> (<jp>そく</jp>).<br><br>

4	町	Town	Rice Paddy,Street	田,丁	"When you see both a <radical>rice paddy</radical> and a <radical>street</radical> in the same place, you have the makings of a whole <kanji>town</kanji>!<br><br>

- Hint: Think about it, a single farm wouldn't need a whole street. Just paths would do. There is a street next to this rice paddy, so there must be other people, which makes this a <kanji>town</kanji>."	<reading><jp>ちょう</jp></reading>	<jp>まち</jp>	None	ちょう	"You go to visit this nice little <kanji>town</kanji>. But then, there she is... Every time you walk down the street, the street-woman Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<jp>ちょう</jp>) arrives to ruin your day.<br><br>

- Hint: Remember imagining Mrs. Chou in great detail in level 2? Time for some of that work to come to fruition. Imagine Mrs. Chou walking down the street of the town towards you, ready to make your day bad. She breaks things as she walks towards you, then knocks you down for walking around in her town. She says, ""Wherever there's a street, you'll find Mrs. Chou."" Then spits on your back as she walks away."
3	外	Outside	Evening,Toe	夕,ト	"You're known to get the ailment <radical>evening</radical> <radical>toe</radical>, which is when your toe catches on fire after getting really, really hot (imagine this happening, ouch!). The only way to fix it is to cool your toe down, and the best way to do that is to go <kanji>outside</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: After imagining your <radical>evening</radical> <radical>toe</radical> overheating, rush <kanji>outside</kanji> to fix it. It's the best way to prevent fire toe, which is way worse. In the evening it's nice and cold outside too, so feel this on your skin, and feel the cold air on your toe, which is starting to get some relief."	<reading><jp>がい</jp></reading>	<jp>そと, はず</jp>	None	がい	"You go <kanji>outside</kanji> (you’re not supposed to be out there at night!) and you’re accosted by a couple of guys. Then, all of a sudden, <reading>Guy</reading> (<jp>がい</jp>) Fawkes jumps from the roof above you and takes them out, then starts running. “Guy Fawkes!” you yell after him!<br><br>

- Hint: If you don’t know Guy Fawkes, you should do a little reading up on him to make this mnemonic make sense. Also, Anonymous People wear a Guy Fawkes mask, if that helps any."
4	石	Stone	Stone	石	"The <radical>stone</radical> radical and <kanji>stone</kanji> kanji are the same thing!<br><br>

- Hint: Know your radicals and therefore know your kanji. It's just that simple."	<reading><jp>せき</jp></reading>	<jp>いし</jp>	None	せき	"You throw a <kanji>stone</kanji> through a window... and, now you can see something very <reading>sexy</reading> (<jp>せき</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Whoops, maybe you shouldn't throw stones through windows or you'll see people's sexy times."
3	北	North	Fingers,Spoon	扌,匕	"Balance a <radical>spoon</radical> on your pointed <radical>fingers</radical> and it will always point <kanji>north</kanji>. The spoon is like a compass needle and your fingers guide the knowledge your body already has and uses it to point north. That's science, friends!<br><br>

Notice how the fingers radical is a little different here? That's because you're pointing them really hard.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine taking a spoon and balancing it on your fingers. Now watch the spoon spin spin spin until it stops and ultimately points north."	<reading><jp>ほく</jp></reading>	<jp>きた</jp>	None	ほく	"You realize that this ability to find <kanji>north</kanji> is probably really valuable, so you go to the nearest pawn shop and <reading>hock</reading> (<jp>ほく</jp>) it. Even your fingers.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine walking out of a pawn shop after hocking your fingers and spoon and realizing that you don't know where you are. Oh, if only you could tell where north was..."
3	毛	Fur,Hair	Fur	毛	"<kanji>Fur</kanji> and <radical>fur</radical> are the same as each other, so the meaning of this kanji should be simple. This can also mean <kanji>hair</kanji>, too, though more like furry hair.<br><br>

- Hint: Just make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise it won't be as simple as I'd hoped."	<reading><jp>もう</jp></reading>	<jp>け</jp>	None	もう	"With <kanji>fur</kanji>, wisp your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it’s fur). You’re surrounded by the black fur, the wind is blowing. Imagine yourself touching the long fur and smelling it. What does it feel / smell like? Now it’s time to get rid of it. There’s just too much <kanji>hair</kanji>! To get rid of it, you’ll need to <reading>mow</reading> (<jp>もう</jp>) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they’re loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think “fur → In the fur → getting rid of the fur → mow the fur,” in that order. That’ll get you to mow, which will help you to remember the on’yomi.<br><br>

- Hint: Smell the <kanji>fur</kanji> as you <reading>mow</reading> it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better."
7	強	Strong,Strength	Bow,Private,Insect	弓,ム,虫	"You have a <radical>private</radical> <radical>bow</radical> made of <radical>insect</radical>s that's extremely <kanji>strong</kanji>. Insect bodies are really durable, so they make for strong bows. You also have to be strong to use it, since it was made just for strong arms.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine holding this strong bow in your strong arms. Look closer at the little insect bodies that make it up. Thanks for your help, little guys."	<reading><jp>きょう</jp></reading>	<jp>つよ</jp>	None	きょう	"You had this <kanji>strong</kanji> bow made especially for you in <reading><jp>きょう</jp></reading>. <jp>きょうと</jp> is famous for their strong bows, so if you ever want another, you know where to go.<br><br>

3	心	Heart	Heart	心	"The radical <radical>heart</radical> and the kanji <kanji>heart</kanji> are the same. Rejoice and let your heart be free!<br><br>

- Hint: Also, make sure you know the radicals by heart, it'll help you to learn more effectively, just like with this kanji."	<reading><jp>しん</jp></reading>	<jp>こころ</jp>	None	しん	"The <kanji>heart</kanji>, where is it stored in your body? Most people thought it was in the chest, but in reality, your <kanji>heart</kanji> is stored in your <reading>shin</reading> (<jp>しん</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: This is when I start kicking you in the shin and you imagine feeling the pain of getting kicked there. As I kick you in the shin, you grab your chest... all this stress is giving you a heart attack (though your shin hurts a ton too)."
2	左	Left	Narwhal,Construction	ナ,工	"<radical>Narwhal</radical>s do <radical>construction</radical> with their left hands (or flippers, I guess). That's because all narwhals are left-handed!<br><br>

- Hint: Picture a bunch of narwhals constructing an underwater ice village. They're all working away with their left hands."	<reading><jp>さ</jp></reading>	<jp>ひだり</jp>	None	さ	"In their <kanji>left</kanji> hands, the narwhals all hold <reading>saw</reading>s (<jp>さ</jp>). That's because the ice for their homes is already there, so they just need to saw away at them to make the shapes they want. Narwhal construction is actually very simple.<br><br>

- Hint: If you're right-handed, imagine trying to use these left-handed saws. It flips and flops all over until you drop it. But if you're left-handed it feels just right!"
2	右	Right	Narwhal,Mouth	ナ,口	"<radical>Narwhal</radical> <radical>mouth</radical>s are on the <kanji>right</kanji> side of their head. In fact, some people didn't think they had mouths at all because they weren't looking from the right. Rookie mistake.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine looking at a narwhal from the front. No mouth. Now look at it from the right. Mouth!"	<reading><jp>ゆう, う</jp></reading>	<jp>みぎ</jp>	None	ゆう, う	"How did we know to look from the <kanji>right</kanji>, though? Because of the <reading>you</reading>ths (<jp>ゆう</jp>). Youths think in ways that older people usually don't. That's why they can see the swirls on cereal, hear the music behind noise, and of course, look at things from the right side.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine a bunch of youths walking in a group and looking at everything from the right. You remember when you were a youth and you used to look at everything from one side too.<br><br>

- Hint: Note: All the <jp>ゆう</jp> readings will use the word ""youths"" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these ""youths"" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world, just like how people treat Millennials nowadays."
1	上	Above,Up,Over	Toe,Ground	ト,一	"You find a <radical>toe</radical> on the <radical>ground</radical>. It's weird, because it's <kanji>above</kanji> the ground, not where toes belong.<br><br>

- Hint: Focus your imagination on how body parts should be buried, not above ground like this. Sure, finding a toe is a little strange, but finding a toe above the ground? Downright silly."	<reading><jp>じょう</jp></reading>	<jp>うえ, あ, のぼ, うわ, かみ</jp>	None	じょう	"Of course when you find a toe <kanji>above</kanji> the ground, you want to know where the toe came from. When you examine it, you see a name written on there. This toe belongs to the local clumsy farmhand, <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<jp>じょう</jp>).<br><br>

- Hint: Try to remember Jourm, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is <jp>じょう</jp>.<br><br>

- Hint: He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) <jp>じょ</jp>. Although Jourm will develop as you go through all the <jp>じょう</jp> reading kanji, for now just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude who works for a local farmer. Also, he only has nine or fewer toes, apparently."
2	玉	Ball	King,Drop	王,丶	"The <radical>king</radical> has something in his hand that he's <radical>drop</radical>ping... but it bounces too! He's bouncing a <kanji>ball</kanji><br><br>

- Hint: This kanji looks just like a king bouncing a <kanji>ball</kanji>, no? If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the <kanji>ball</kanji>) over and over again, then laying some hoops like a pro."	<jp>ぎょく</jp>	<reading><jp>たま</jp></reading>	None	たま	"Think of someone curled up in a ball.

- Hint: If you know the radicals then this one is EZPZ."	<reading><jp>か</jp></reading>	<jp>ひ, ほ</jp>	None	か	"Whenever we need to remember <jp>か</jp>, we use the word <reading>car</reading>.<br><br>

For this kanji, when we think <kanji>fire</kanji>, we ought to think of something on fire. What's on fire? It's obviously your very own <reading>car</reading> (<jp>か</jp>)! Oh Goddd NOOO!<br><br>

- Hint: Oh no... Oh no!! If you don't have a <reading>car</reading>, imagine what it'd feel like if your car just exploded and burned down. If you do have a car, imagine your own car in this situation. It should be a terrible feeling, if you imagine it well enough. So, when you think <kanji>fire</kanji>, remember the fear you had when your car was given to the flames. Now you have to walk everywhere, sad :("
2	土	Dirt,Soil,Earth,Ground	Dirt	土	"The <radical>dirt</radical> radical and the <kanji>dirt</kanji> kanji are the same!<br><br>

- Hint: As long as you know the radical dirt, you know the kanji dirt."	<reading><jp>ど, と</jp></reading>	<jp>つち</jp>	None	ど, と	"Who spends a lot of time in <kanji>dirt</kanji>? <reading>Do</reading>gs (<jp>ど</jp>) do!

- Hint: Dogs and dirt just go together!"
2	白	White	White	白	"The radical <radical>white</radical> and the kanji <kanji>white</kanji> are the same.<br><br>

- Hint: Study your radicals hard! Most important thing!"	<reading><jp>はく</jp></reading>	<jp>しろ, しら</jp>	None	はく	"The <kanji>white</kanji> team was the first to be able to <reading>hack</reading> (<jp>はく</jp>) the <kanji>white</kanji> iPhone.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine two teams (black and <kanji>white</kanji>), wearing their team colors, working really hard on hacking the iPhone. It is a huge contest, and people are watching with a lot of tension, to see who will hack the <kanji>white</kanji> iPhone first. Feel that tension, and see the colors separating them so vividly. The colors are important, and the excitement of the winner holding up the <reading>hack</reading>ed iPhone is too."
2	水	Water	Water	水	"The <radical>water</radical> radical and the <kanji>water</kanji> kanji are the same.<br><br>

- Hint: So as long as you know the radicals, you know the kanji."	<reading><jp>すい</jp></reading>	<jp>みず</jp>	None	すい	"Imagine a lake (i.e. a whole bunch of <kanji>water</kanji>). When you think of water, you should try to think of this beautiful lake. It’s sunny, the trees smell nice (imagine a tree smell if you can – the more senses you use the better!) and on that tree there is an awesome tire <reading>swi</reading>ng (<jp>すい</jp>). You get onto the tire swing and you are swinging back and forth. The water is right in front of you, and you are able to use the swing to throw yourself into the water. It’s a lot colder than you expected, and you come back to the surface, gasping for breath. The water gets into your mouth and you taste it. How strange, it’s very, very <reading>swee</reading>t. Imagine the sweetness of the water and how weird it is (really really sweet, this water is).<br><br>

- Hint: I know that was a long one, but try to imagine all the different bits. Try to feel the feelings (cold, smell, etc) too. The more you create in this fake memory (which you’re using to remember and associate water with <jp>すい</jp> (swing)) the more likely you are to end up remembering enough to make it happen. Especially when it comes to the senses part, the more vividly you imagined it, the more likely you are to remember the on’yomi."
2	木	Tree,Wood	Tree	木	"This is another kanji that is the same as the radical. Both <radical>tree</radical> and <kanji>tree</kanji> are the same in looks and meaning.<br><br>

- Hint: So, how are those radicals doing? Do you know them well?"	<reading><jp>もく, ぼく</jp></reading>	<jp>き, こ</jp>	None	もく, ぼく	"You’re walking through the trees, looking at them. They look ominous.

Everything from the past is in the dirt. Dead people, dinosaur bones, your mom's secrets in a box from her past life. All these things come back to you as you slide the dirt all over your legs.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine the feeling of dirt on your legs. Now think back to the previous day. The previous year. The previous century."	<reading><jp>せん</jp></reading>	<jp>さき, まず</jp>	None	せん	"As you sit there, pretending you're in a <kanji>previous</kanji> time you see a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<jp>せん</jp>)! That's right! Centaurs are from wayyyy in the <kanji>past</kanji>.<br><br>

- Hint: Centaurs were definitely real in the past. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. They're just afraid of the truth."
33	砂	Sand	Stone,Few	石,少	"If you grind a <radical>stone</radical> down to more than just a <radical>few</radical> pieces, it will become <kanji>sand</kanji>. Stones that get broken up enough will become sand, and you pick up a few grains in your hand.<br><br>

- Hint: Feel these few grains of sand between your fingertips. Imagine the stones that they originally came from. Nature is crazy."	<reading><jp>さ</jp></reading>	<jp>すな</jp>	None	さ	"What’s in your hand? A few grains of <reading>sa</reading>nd (<jp>さ</jp>)! <kanji>Sand</kanji>, sand, sand!<br><br>

Now sell them for two, three, four times the profit!"	<reading><jp>り</jp></reading>	<jp>き</jp>	None	り	"To make an even better <kanji>profit</kanji>, you decide to cut up <reading>ree</reading>ds (<jp>り</jp>) too. You stuff the grains in the reeds and sell that as ""self-cooking"" sets.<br><br>

- Hint: You thought Jourm was an ordinary, clumsy, ten foot tall farmhand. But he brought down a tsunami upon your village. And, he brought armed conflict too. This thing he calls ""The cleanse"" was actually something he had been planning for years. His use of a totally ordinary Viking mouth towel... his table made of foreheads... That tatami mat altar with the forehead wearing a top hat... Was he really a Viking pretending to be a simple farmhand just so he could bring his men inland to cleanse and purify your village? It's too late now. Jourm stands over your body. You are about to receive ""The cleanse"" too."

You look down and it's a wheel of <reading>chee</reading>se (<jp>ち</jp>)! At first you're angry, until you realize that this must be a sign. Cheese IS wisdom.

This kanji also has a second meaning. That shellfish you pierced with the window is in two halves now. You can use those halves as plates for sushi. If you count the broken shells you'll know how much sushi you have. That makes them <kanji>sushi counter</kanji>s!<br><br>

You see, prisons aren't built very carefully, they just try to get them done fast enough to stuff people in there. So while you can tell this was once a building, it definitely isn't a prison anymore, since the whole thing caved in.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture the cave in in your mind. Can you see all the little prisoners and guards being squished as the building tumbles down around them?

- Hint: Go! Go row! Go and row for the fishing! How do you go? You row! The row part should be pretty easy to remember since you gotta row your boat out to sea, but if you’re having trouble with the go part, just remember that it has the same reading as <jp>魚</jp>."

The brush isn’t big enough for more than two people, so unless you have a lot of brush, you won’t be saving many people from the tsunami.<br><br>

- Hint: Since there is room for two people in the brush, imagine yourself in the haven with one other person. They and you make two. The other person is a real whiner though - imagine them crying the whole time."

""That's my bow you're stretching!"" yells Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<jp>ちょう</jp>). She is not happy that you're stretching her things.

- Hint: Now Mrs. Chou is hitting you with the stretched out bow. You cry and apologize, but she won't listen. ""I'm going to stretch you, like you stretched my bow,"" she says. Then she does it."
5	空	Sky,Empty	Roof,Legs,Construction	宀,儿,工	"Giving a <radical>roof</radical> <radical>legs</radical> is the kind of <radical>construction</radical> you do.

On their uniform is “The Ritz” written in fine lettering, and as you walk past them, they stand up straight and say “Welcome to the Ritz!” Whatever you do, while you’re thinking about it, make sure you think about how they stand up so straight, and associate it with these doormen, who work, specifically, at the Ritz.

While this is already strange enough, you notice something stranger. Over a couple feet away is a <reading>dou</reading>ghnut (<jp>どう</jp>) who also has the <kanji>same</kanji> mustache as you (and the one that fell on the ground). The doughnut looks at you for a moment, then scampers off. This doughnut must be a mutant because normally doughnuts don't move.<br><br>

- Hint: If it helps, imagine hundreds or thousands of doughnuts all around you with the same exact mustache. First of all, it's terrifying to be surrounded by thousands of mutant doughnuts. Secondly, it's really weird they all have the same mustache as you."

She's the only person evil enough to do something like this.<br><br>

- Hint: You can also imagine Mrs. Chou doing the act of carving someone's hair out, but that may just be too much."

- Hint: You watch nervously as this model of Genghis Khan is finished. You're really not sure if this is who you were meant to model it after, but it's too late to change it now. Genghis Khan it is!"

16	取	Take	Ear,Stool	耳,又	"There's an <radical>ear</radical> just sitting on a <radical>stool</radical>. Nobody's watching, so, you <kanji>take</kanji> it.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture a tin can in your mind as clearly as you can."	<reading><jp>かん</jp></reading>	None	None	かん	"The reading for a <kanji>can</kanji> is <jp>かん</jp>, which seems impossibly easy. If that isn't close enough for you, picture this:<br><br>

If you could protect your land from the West, then you can certainly defend the stars too!<br><br>

- Hint: Now you're soaring through between the stars, swinging your saber through the silence of space, and... wait. No that was a dream. You roll over and pat your saber. The two of you are ready just in case the stars need your help."
1	七	Seven	Seven	七	"Lucky for you (as is the case with many of the lower-stroke kanji), this kanji is the same as the radical you've already learned. The radical that makes up this kanji is <radical>seven</radical> and the kanji (which is exactly the same) is also <kanji>seven</kanji>.

- Hint: How unbelievable is it that someone got <kanji>seven</kanji> percent on a test, especially if you try to cheat? Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the ""she"" part in <reading>she chea</reading>ted (<jp>しち</jp>).

56	弊	Evil	Penguin,Twenty	敝,廾	"<radical>Twenty</radical> <radical>penguin</radical>s together are always <kanji>evil</kanji>. Penguins are seen in groups a lot, sure, but did you know that any time there are exactly twenty penguins in a group they're plotting evil things? Evil things like global warming.

Your family will never know what happened to you. The penguins will get away with their evil plans.<br><br>

- Hint: Only someone or, in this case, something truly evil would kill someone and hide their remains under some hay. That's really disrespectful and, well, evil."
12	息	Breath	Self,Heart	自,心	"Imagining one’s <radical>self</radical> without a <radical>heart</radical> can make it hard to draw <kanji>breath</kanji>.

- Hint: Imagine trying to live without a heart. You couldn’t. Your blood stops flowing and your body shuts down. You would no longer be able to draw breath."	<reading><jp>そく</jp></reading>	<jp>いき</jp>	None	そく	"You know how when people are unconscious and their <kanji>breath</kanji> slows or comes to a stop, they use smelling salts to revive them? Well a smelly <reading>sock</reading> (<jp>そく</jp>) can work just as well. Socks get really stinky and their stench is powerful enough to revive someone who isn’t drawing breath.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine smelling this smelly sock. Imagine the smelly stench of the dirty sock wafting up into your nostrils and filling your lungs with its odor. Gross."
6	思	Think,Thought	Rice Paddy,Heart	田,心	"In a <radical>rice paddy</radical> you find a <radical>heart</radical> and it makes you <kanji>think</kanji>. You think a lot of <kanji>thought</kanji>s like, ""Whose heart is this? Why is it in a rice paddy? Why am I thinking out loud?""<br><br>

Moe</reading> (<jp>おも</jp>) is his name!<br><br>

- Hint: If you don't know Moe from the Simpsons use a different Moe, perhaps the one from the Three Stooges? You should be able to come up with one. Think really hard about the Moe you know best and imagine them standing watching you from the edge of the rice field."
9	乗	Ride	Grain,Mouth	禾,口	"You put a <radical>grain</radical> in your <radical>mouth</radical> and let it take a <kanji>ride</kanji>.

It's going for a nice ride in your mouth!"	<jp>じょう</jp>	<reading><jp>の</jp></reading>	None	の	"You decide the grain is probably lonely on this <kanji>ride</kanji> alone, so you add some <reading>no</reading>ri (<jp>の</jp>) seaweed, so it has a friend.<br><br>

9	客	Guest,Customer	Roof,Winter,Mouth	宀,夂,口	"Under your <radical>roof</radical> in <radical>winter</radical> there are more <radical>mouth</radical>s to feed because you let <kanji>guest</kanji>s stay with you when it's cold. Some of them aren't family, so they have to pay to stay under your roof and get food. Those are <kanji>customer</kanji>s.<br><br>

- Hint: Picture all of the hungry guests and customers under your roof, eating your food and sleeping on your floor."	<reading><jp>きゃく</jp></reading>	None	None	きゃく	"One of your <kanji>guest</kanji>s is a regular named <reading>Kyaku</reading> (<jp>きゃく</jp>) the <kanji>customer</kanji>.

He holds up his own sword, challenging the gladiator, who just shakes his head and points at your ticket again.<br><br>

- Hint: Ken takes a long time to examine your ticket. I don't think he understands that he needs a ticket to fight the gladiator. Maybe you should give him yours."
9	持	Hold	Fingers,Temple	扌,寺	"You need to get your <radical>fingers</radical> around a <radical>temple</radical> if you want to <kanji>hold</kanji> it. Is the temple too big? Hold smaller temples you can buy in the temple's souvenir shop.<br><br>

- Hint: Imagine yourself counting and counting smaller and smaller mouths inside of each other, recording the number of times you can find a mouth inside another mouth.
