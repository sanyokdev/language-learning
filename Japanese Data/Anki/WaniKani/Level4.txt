寸	Radical				Measurement	Measurement, Measure															Have you ever used one of those math compasses? This looks just like one of those because this is the <radical>measurement</radical> radical. Compasses are used to measure things, just like this.					357	-	Lesson_4 radical
ｲ	Radical				Leader	Leader															This radical technically means person (like <ja>人</ja>), but we're going to shift the meaning a little bit. It's kind of like the person radical, but it's taller and skinnier, standing above the rest of those peons. That's why this is a <radical>leader</radical>, not a regular old person.					358	-	Lesson_4 radical
冖	Radical				Forehead	Forehead															Sure, this <radical>forehead</radical> is a bit square, but that's because it's Frankenstein's Monster's forehead. Also, did you notice that this is just the top part of the head (<ja>冂</ja>) radical? This is just the forehead part of that!					359	-	Lesson_4 radical
也	Radical				Alligator	Alligator															See the mouth and teeth of this <radical>alligator</radical>, which is facing to the right? You wouldn't want to get your hand stuck in there, that's for sure.					360	-	Lesson_4 radical
宀	Radical				Roof	Roof, Helmet															This is a <radical>roof</radical>. You know it's a roof and not a forehead because there's a little chimney sticking out of the top. And foreheads definitely don't have chimneys.					361	-	Lesson_4 radical
弋	Radical				Ceremony	Ceremony															This radical looks like a person with a long dress or train running behind them. That's because it's a bride or groom going to their wedding <radical>ceremony</radical>! You usually have to wear a long dress or a cape if you're at a ceremony. So when you see this radical, think of all the different ceremonies you might have to go to in your life and what you'll need to wear.					362	-	Lesson_4 radical
ネ	Radical				Spirit	Spirit, Pelican															This looks just like the katakana character for ne. Ne for necromancer! That makes this a <radical>spirit</radical>, brought back from the grave. OooooOOoooOoo!					363	-	Lesson_4 radical
支	Radical				Branch	Branch, Frog															There is a cross growing out of this stool. It's <radical>branch</radical>ing off of it, if you will. The tree that this stool was made of is coming back to life in the form of a branch.					364	-	Lesson_4 radical
气	Radical				Energy	Energy															This radical is shaped kind of like a dam. See the wall and the water pushing over the top? If this radical is a dam, then it must create a ton of <radical>energy</radical> as well!					365	-	Lesson_4 radical
世	Radical				World	World, Generation															There are no circles in kanji, remember? So imagine that these angles are really circles. A little circle in a big circle, with a line running through them. Why, it's the <radical>world</radical>. The world looks just like this, with continents on the globe and a line is the equator. Can you see it?					366	-	Lesson_4 radical
皿	Radical				Plate	Plate															This is a few <radical>plate</radical>s drying on a rack. They're stacked together in a line. Imagine reaching out and grabbing one of those plates for yourself.					367	-	Lesson_4 radical
竹	Radical				Bamboo	Bamboo															See how tall the stalks are with little bushy things at the top? It kind of looks like <radical>bamboo</radical>, if you use your imagination.					368	-	Lesson_4 radical
糸	Radical				Thread	Thread															There is something small in some poop. You lean in, carefully pull it out, and realize it's a <radical>thread</radical>. Why is there some thread in this small poop? Because it's cat poop. And cats love to eat thread when you aren't looking. And floss and hoodie strings and mouse tails. But this poop just has thread in it.					369	-	Lesson_4 radical
耳	Radical				Ear	Ear															This radical is a bit more elaborate than the eye, though similar. In fact, if you go blind, your <radical>ear</radical>s become one of your new senses of sight, which is why this is like another, somewhat modified, eye. You'll even notice little lines sticking out of the eye. That's because ears stick out more than eyes (<ja>目</ja>), which is why this radical is the ear radical.					370	-	Lesson_4 radical
虫	Radical				Insect	Insect, Bug															There is something private in your mouth. You're keeping it private because you don't want other people to judge you. Why? Because it's an <radical>insect</radical>. You like to eat insects, but society seems to think it's wrong. Don't worry, friend. Someday the rest of the world will embrace eating insects like you have.					371	-	Lesson_4 radical
艹	Radical				Flowers	Flowers															See the little things sticking out of the ground? Those little things are pretty little <radical>flowers</radical>. You know they're flowers and not, say, grass, because they're spaced out. You'll learn grass later, and it will be less spaced out, but somewhat similar to this, so keep that in mind!					372	-	Lesson_4 radical
見	Radical				See	See															There's an eyeball on top of some legs. When your eyes get taken places (on legs, in this case), your eyes are <radical>see</radical>ing those things. That's why this radical means see.					373	-	Lesson_4 radical
赤	Radical				Red	Red															There are some legs and fins under the dirt. Imagine yourself looking at all of these severed limbs... there's blood everywhere. No matter how deep you dig, everything is stained <radical>red</radical>.					374	-	Lesson_4 radical
車	Radical				Car	Car															Doesn't this look like a top-down view of the frame of a <radical>car</radical>? There are the rods that make up the base of the car and things for the wheels to go on. That's why this radical is the car radical.					375	-	Lesson_4 radical
貝	Radical				Shellfish	Shellfish, Clam															There's a giant eye on top of some fins. Imagine this giant eye to be on top of a clam or a mussel. It has little fins, which it runs around on, escaping from your every attempt to capture it. That's why this is the <radical>shellfish</radical> radical.					376	-	Lesson_4 radical
足	Radical				Foot	Foot															Do you see the dude doing a flying dragon kick to the right? What does he hit the target with? Obviously it's his <radical>foot</radical>.					377	-	Lesson_4 radical
不	Radical				Not	Not															"If you see this radical in a kanji, you'll want to think of the opposite of whatever other radicals there are. It looks a lot like ""below,"" but guess what? It's <radical>not</radical> the below radical. It's just not."					378	-	Lesson_4 radical
士	Radical				Samurai	Samurai															The <radical>samurai</radical> radical looks a lot like the dirt radical. The difference is in the top horizontal line. For samurai, the top is longer because he's holding swords. Dirt can't really hold anything because its arms are too short. So when you see this radical, think: long arms for some long swords. That's a samurai!					379	-	Lesson_4 radical
米	Radical				Rice	Rice															"Not to be confused with a rice paddy (<ja>田</ja>). This is just raw <radical>rice</radical>, like the grain that grows out of the ground when rice is raw and fresh. When rice is particularly ripe, it'll kind of look like this at the top of the stalks. See the long leaves with the little rice tufts at the top? That's why this radical is ""rice."""					380	-	Lesson_4 radical
彳	Radical				Loiter	Loiter															The leader (<ja>ｲ</ja>) radical has a little something extra on top of him, holding him down, holding him back. It's causing him to wait... it's causing him to <radical>loiter</radical>.					381	-	Lesson_4 radical
巴	Radical				Bed	Bed															You'll have to complete the line on the right side in your mind, but see the rectangle <radical>bed</radical> and the pillows? This is totally a bed. That missing line is where you pulled back the sheets when you got up this morning.					382	-	Lesson_4 radical
兀	Radical				Pi	Pi															Obviously, this looks just like the good ol' 3.14 something-something all people are supposed to learn about. It's the math symbol that has to do with circles... <radical>pi</radical>!					383	-	Lesson_4 radical
厂	Radical				Cliff	Cliff															See the <radical>cliff</radical>? It's facing towards the west. What ocean is to your west? That's the direction this cliff is facing.					384	-	Lesson_4 radical
主	Radical				Master	Master															This king has a drop of water floating above his head. That's because he's not just a king, he's the <radical>master</radical> of water. Master of elements. Master of ALL THINGS!					385	-	Lesson_4 radical
乚	Radical				Umbrella	Umbrella															Do you know how the bottom of an <radical>umbrella</radical> is shaped? It has a hook that curls around for the handle. So when you see this radical, you should think of the bottom of an umbrella, which will help you remember that it means umbrella.					386	-	Lesson_4 radical
<i class=radical-beggar></i>	Radical				Beggar	Beggar															Doesn't this look like someone on their knees, holding their hands out (clasped) and begging for something (money, their life, etc.)? That's why this radical is known as the <radical>beggar</radical>.					387	-	Lesson_4 radical
<i class=radical-horns></i>	Radical				Horns	Horns															Can you see the <radical>horns</radical>? You could put these horns on anything. Donkeys, people, monkeys, and so on. That's exactly what we'll be doing when we learn kanji that have horns too.					388	-	Lesson_4 radical
<i class=radical-spikes></i>	Radical				Spikes	Spikes															On the ground there are a bunch of <radical>spikes</radical> coming out. You wouldn't want to step on those now, would you?					389	-	Lesson_4 radical
世	Kanji	世	World	radical	World, Generation	World, Generation		<reading>せ</reading> <reading>せい</reading>	よ			せ, せい	よ								The <radical>world</radical> radical and the <kanji>world</kanji> kanji are the same, but there is another really important meaning you need to know: <kanji>generation</kanji>.   Think of it this way: the world is just made up of many different generations of people, plants, and animals all getting along together.	It's all these generational differences that make the world go 'round!	It's your job to protect the <kanji>world</kanji> and every <kanji>generation</kanji> with your special <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>). It was given to you to uphold correctness, and you'll pass it on to the next generation when it's time. Then they'll watch out for the world when you're gone.	Hold the saber up high and pledge to protect the world for all of the generations to come! Then swish it around and make buzzing sounds with your mouth.		390	-	kanji Lesson_4
主	Kanji	主	Master	radical	Master, Main	Master, Main		<reading>しゅ</reading>	おも ぬし			しゅ	おも, ぬし								The radical <radical>master</radical> and the kanji <kanji>master</kanji> have the same meanings!  This kanji also means <kanji>main</kanji> because the master is the main person of a dojo or household or business.		Do you remember back to the radical mnemonic, where the <kanji>master</kanji> is floating a water drop above his head? Imagine back to there. Once you do, the most amazing thing happens. The master sends the drop of water into a <reading>chu</reading>te (<ja>しゅ</ja>) and it goes careening through an intricate series of them.	Picture this master of water controlling the droplet as it flies around inside these chutes, like he's solving a difficult puzzle with it. Astounding!		391	-	kanji Lesson_4
他	Kanji	ｲ, 也	Leader, Alligator	radical, radical	Other	Other		<reading>た</reading>	ほか			た	ほか								The <radical>leader</radical> of <radical>alligators</radical>... he's no ordinary leader, that's for sure. He's not a politician.. he's not a king... He's one of the <kanji>Other</kanji> Ones, a group of strange, eccentric people who become leaders of animals.	"Imagine different groups of leaders - they're all dressed nice and normal. Then, off to the side are the leaders who are leaders of bears, cats, alligators, and narwhals... they're the <kanji>other</kanji> ones, no matter how you look at it. They are in their own group, and they are considered ""others"" because society won't accept them :("	"To remember the reading <ja>た</ja>, we use the word ""Taco""  Then there's the <kanji>other</kanji>s of the others. These are the <reading>ta</reading>co (<ja>た</ja>) worshipers. They're really strange."	"Just imagine the ""others"" shaking their heads at these taco worshipers. Seriously, what the heck?"		392	-	kanji Lesson_4
代	Kanji	ｲ, 弋	Leader, Ceremony	radical, radical	Substitute, Replace, Period, Age	Substitute, Replace, Period, Age		<reading>だい</reading>	か かわ しろ			だい	か, かわ, しろ								The <radical>leader</radical> for the <radical>ceremony</radical> can't come so you need a <kanji>substitute</kanji> to <kanji>replace</kanji> them ASAP!  This kanji has another meaning too. The leader can't come to the ceremony because they forgot what <kanji>period</kanji> of time it was. If they think they're in the wrong <kanji>age</kanji>, they won't come because they're trying to lead some monkeys in the ceremony instead.	Picture the leader of the ceremony out back, unsure of what period or age they're in, while the substitute leader walks in and stares at them in shock.	The <kanji>substitute</kanji> leader is wearing the wrong color clothes, so you have to <reading>dye</reading> (<ja>だい</ja>) them, like they did in the olden <kanji>age</kanji>s.	Now you're out back with the original leader and the substitute leader, trying to dye the color of this stupid shirt to match that one.		393	-	kanji Lesson_4
写	Kanji	冖, 一, <i class=radical-beggar></i>	Forehead, Ground, Beggar	radical, radical, radical	Copy	Copy		<reading>しゃ</reading>	うつ			しゃ	うつ								The <radical>beggar</radical> is pointing his <radical>forehead</radical> up at you, his feet trapped in the <radical>ground</radical>. What diabolical scheme are you planning with this poor beggar you trapped? Turns out, you're planning to <kanji>copy</kanji> him to have your own version of him.	You can imagine the whole story - him walking along, you setting a trap... and then whamo! You catch him. Then, come up with some crazy way / invention you're going to copy him. Are you cloning? Are you just taking his skin? Are you removing his forehead to grab his brain? Up to you - just make sure you make it ridiculous enough to remember.	"To remember the reading <ja>しゃ</ja>, we use the word ""shaman"".  You finally decide on how you're going to <kanji>copy</kanji> him. You hire a <reading>sha</reading>man (<ja>しゃ</ja>) and have the shaman perform a sacred shaman cloning ritual."	The shaman runs around for a bit, doing ridiculous things. Imagine it dancing about and mumbling shamanic chants as the beggar is copied.		394	-	kanji Lesson_4
去	Kanji	土, ム	Dirt, Private	radical, radical	Past	Past		<reading>きょ</reading> <reading>こ</reading>	さ			きょ, こ	さ								If someone tries to dig up <radical>private</radical> <radical>dirt</radical> on you, tell them no thanks, that stuff is in the <kanji>past</kanji>. Some things should stay in the past. Not everyone needs to know everything about your life and your past.	Keep your private dirt in the past. It's better for everyone.	"To remember the reading <ja>きょ</ja>, we'll use ""Little Kyoto."" This will differentiate <ja>きょ</ja> from <ja>きょう</ja>, which is regular-sized Kyoto. Get it? You decide to bury all this private dirt from your <kanji>past</kanji> in Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょ</ja>). That stuff is from when you were just a little <ja><reading>子</reading></ja> (<ja>こ</ja>) and you don't like to think about it."	Imagine physically, literally burying your past <ja>子</ja> self. If you hide it in Little Kyoto, no one will ever be able to dig it up.		395	-	kanji Lesson_4
号	Kanji	口, 一, 勹	Mouth, Ground, Prison	radical, radical, radical	Number	Number		<reading>ごう</reading>				ごう									There's a <radical>mouth</radical> in the <radical>ground</radical> (in our case, it's a hatch), and inside is some kind of <radical>prison</radical> you can't quite get to. If you've ever seen Lost, this will sound familiar... on the hatch, there's actually a series of <kanji>number</kanji>s that you don't understand.	What are these numbers? What do they mean? Think over it for a while, get frustrated, and try to figure it out. You can't, though, so you probably won't ever get inside.	"""You want to know the <kanji>number</kanji> to the hatch?"" yells an old voice from inside. You say ""yes,"" and the voice gives you the numbers and you're in! You go down into the prison, where there is one prisoner: Grandpa Koichi (<ja><reading>ごう</reading>いち</ja>).  Note: For <ja>ごう</ja> reading mnemonics, we use <ja>ごういち</ja> (grandpa Koichi) because <ja>こういち</ja> is used for the <ja>こう</ja> reading. <ja>こう</ja> becomes <ja>ごう</ja> becomes ""grandpa <ja>ごういち</ja>."""	<ja>ごういち</ja> keeps saying numbers as you free him from the prison. Just one after another. Numbers numbers numbers. Hopefully old man <ja>ごういち</ja> isn't crazy.		396	-	kanji Lesson_4
央	Kanji	大, 冂	Big, Head	radical, radical	Center, Centre	Center, Centre		<reading>おう</reading>				おう									If someone has a <radical>big</radical> <radical>head</radical> you have to try to focus on the <kanji>center</kanji> of it when you talk to them.	You don't want to get caught with your eyes wandering all over their big head. Stare right at the center of their face. Ah geez, their eyes are kinda far away from here. You can really only see their nose...	This is the <kanji>center</kanji> of the <ja><reading>王</reading></ja>'s (<ja>おう</ja>) head so you have to be extra careful not to look anywhere else.	The <ja>王</ja> will definitely cut off your normal-sized head if he sees you looking all over his big head and not at the center.		397	-	kanji Lesson_4
平	Kanji	干, <i class=radical-horns></i>	Dry, Horns	radical, radical	Flat, Peace	Flat, Peace		<reading>へい</reading> <reading>ひょう</reading> <reading>びょう</reading>	たい ひら			へい, ひょう, びょう	たい, ひら								If you want to <radical>dry</radical> your <radical>horns</radical> you need to lay them <kanji>flat</kanji>. If they aren't flat they'll always be a little damp somewhere and you'll never have a moment's <kanji>peace</kanji>.	Imagine carefully taking off your horns and laying them flat on a paper towel. You have to smooth them out so they're as flat as possible.	Being <kanji>flat</kanji> isn't enough, so you cover the whole thing in <reading>hay</reading> (<ja>へい</ja>). Hay absorbs water, so you add a flat layer of it.	Imagine carefully laying a flat layer of hay on top of your flat horns. You feel really at peace and... you're tired now. You decided to lay on top of the hay and take a nap while you wait for your horns to dry.		398	-	kanji Lesson_4
打	Kanji	扌, 丁	Fingers, Street	radical, radical	Hit	Hit, Strike, Pound, Blow		<reading>だ</reading>	う ぶ			だ	う, ぶ								Take your <radical>fingers</radical> to the <radical>street</radical> to <kanji>hit</kanji> some people! Street fingers are for curling into a fist. And that street fist wants to do some hitting!	Imagine: it's just you, your fingers, and the wild street. It's hitting time!	As you <kanji>hit</kanji> one chump after another, suddenly your <reading>da</reading>d (<ja>だ</ja>) comes marching out of your house. Uh oh. Dad caught you hitting, which, honestly, isn't a very nice thing to do, so he has every right to stop you.	"Now imagine your dad saying, ""Don't do a hit!"" over and over at you. ""I'm sorry dad! But the streets were calling me!"""		399	-	kanji Lesson_4
氷	Kanji	水, 丶	Water, Drop	radical, radical	Ice	Ice		ひょう	<reading>こおり</reading>			こおり	ひょう								You have <radical>water</radical> already... and it's pretty cold. All it takes is one cold <radical>drop</radical> of liquid nitrogen added to it to turn it into one big block of ice, just like that.	Go ahead and touch it... wow, it's really cold - and only from one drop, too. Feel the burn on your finger from where you touched the <kanji>ice</kanji>.	When you think of <kanji>ice</kanji>, I want you to think of someone frozen with ice. Do you know anyone named <reading>Corey</reading> (<ja>こおり</ja>)? Anyone famous named Corey, perhaps Corey Feldman? Imagine this Corey person frozen solid with ice.	How did this happen? Was it your fault? Imagine the situation that would get Corey frozen like this.		400	-	kanji Lesson_4
申	Kanji	十, 口	Cross, Mouth	radical, radical	Say Humbly, Say, Humbly Say	Say Humbly, Say, Humbly Say		しん	<reading>もう</reading>			もう	しん								There’s a <radical>cross</radical> in your <radical>mouth</radical>, so the things you say are very pious. Everything you say you <kanji>say humbly</kanji>.	"Imagine yourself with a cross in your mouth, saying all kinds of humble things. ""Oh no, I'm not that good."" ""Oh no, my mustache doesn't look that great."""	When you think of saying humble things, think of the humblest man in the world. His name is <reading>Moe</reading> (<ja>もう</ja>).	Imagine this character in your head. If it helps, you can take a Moe you already know of (Simpsons, perhaps?) and pretend he's extremely humble - ridiculously so. Just remember to make it crazy so you can remember it better.		401	-	kanji Lesson_4
皿	Kanji	皿	Plate	radical	Plate, Dish	Plate, Dish			<reading>さら</reading>			さら									The <kanji>plate</kanji> kanji and the <radical>plate</radical> are exactly the same, like two matching pieces of china.	If you know your radicals, you know your kanji too.	The person washing all the <kanji>dish</kanji>es was named <reading>Sarah</reading> (<ja>さら</ja>). She was named that because of her large head, which was shaped like Sarah Jessica Parker’s head (very big).	Imagine someone with a huge head, washing dishes. When I say huge, I mean huge. She turns towards you with her big head and says “Hi, I’m Sarah” and you see her name tag, which also says Sarah. She is Sarah, the dish washer. The plates she holds up next to her head pale in comparison, even though they're the biggest pieces.		402	-	kanji Lesson_4
礼	Kanji	ネ, 乚	Spirit, Umbrella	radical, radical	Thanks	Thanks		<reading>れい</reading>				れい									Always remember to give <radical>umbrella</radical>s to the <radical>spirit</radical>s to show your <kanji>thanks</kanji>. The next time you're walking by a shrine and you see a statue dedicated to a spirit, leave your umbrella open to protect it. This is the best way you can show your thanks for life, food, shelter, and all that good, good stuff.	"Picture a spirit shrine with an umbrella protecting it from the heavy rain. ""Thanks for everything,"" you say softly."	After you say <kanji>thanks</kanji> to a spirit, sometimes you'll get a gift back. You look down. There is a <reading>ray</reading> (<ja>れい</ja>) gun by your feet. Huh. Maybe you should show your thanks to the ray gun spirit more often.	Thanks for the new ray gun, spirit!		403	-	kanji Lesson_4
休	Kanji	ｲ, 木	Leader, Tree	radical, radical	Rest	Rest		<reading>きゅう</reading>	やす			きゅう	やす								The <radical>leader</radical> is next to the <radical>tree</radical>. What is he doing? He's leaning against it, <kanji>rest</kanji>ing.	The best thing to do with a tree is rest under it. Picture the leader resting under the tree with his eyes half closed.	As he <kanji>rest</kanji>s, he suddenly gets hungry and pulls a <reading>cu</reading>cumber (<ja>きゅう</ja>) off the tree and bites into it. A good rest isn't complete without some crunchy tree cucumbers.	Don't email me saying cucumbers don't grow on trees. Cucumber trees exist. Look them up and then rest easy knowing I'd never lie to you.		404	-	kanji Lesson_4
先	Kanji	丿, 土, 儿	Slide, Dirt, Legs	radical, radical, radical	Previous, Ahead, Past, Former	Previous, Ahead, Past, Former		<reading>せん</reading>	さき まず			せん	さき, まず								<radical>Slide</radical> some <radical>dirt</radical> on your <radical>legs</radical> so you can feel like you're from a <kanji>previous</kanji> time. Everything from the past is in the dirt. Dead people, dinosaur bones, your mom's secrets in a box from her past life. All these things come back to you as you slide the dirt all over your legs.	Imagine the feeling of dirt on your legs. Now think back to the previous day. The previous year. The previous century.	As you sit there, pretending you're in a <kanji>previous</kanji> time you see a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<ja>せん</ja>)! That's right! Centaurs are from wayyyy in the <kanji>past</kanji>.	Centaurs were definitely real in the past. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. They're just afraid of the truth.		405	-	kanji Lesson_4
名	Kanji	夕, 口	Evening, Mouth	radical, radical	Name, Famous	Name, Famous		<reading>めい</reading> <reading>みょう</reading>	な			めい, みょう	な								What is the <radical>evening</radical> <radical>mouth</radical>? Imagine a mouth that’s up in the night sky. It’s just there, talking, and only comes out at night. It only appears in one area of the world (what area would you choose? Imagine yourself going to that place to see the “night mouth.”), and appears only one month out of the year (more on this in a second). The “evening mouth” is the most famous thing in the _____ area (this is the area you choose). He’s so <kanji>famous</kanji> that everybody knows his <kanji>name</kanji> (“Evening Mouth.”).	Imagine yourself going to the area you chose, and watching “Evening Mouth” speak. There are thousands of others there, wanting to see the giant floating mouth in the night sky. “Evening Mouth” then says “Everyone, what’s my <kanji>name</kanji>!?” and everyone shouts back “Evening Mouth!” in unison. “Evening Mouth” has certainly gotten really <kanji>famous</kanji>.	So, when does “Evening Mouth” appear? Turns out, “Evening Mouth” only comes out to talk in <reading>May</reading> (<ja>めい</ja>). You know this because it’s just starting to be spring, and when you look around (you’re watching “Evening Mouth” again) you see some spring flowers come up.	You know what they say. April showers bring May Flowers. What do <reading>May</reading> Flowers bring? They bring “Evening Mouth,” baby.		406	-	kanji Lesson_4
字	Kanji	宀, 子	Roof, Child	radical, radical	Letter, Character, Symbol	Letter, Character, Symbol		<reading>じ</reading>				じ									The <radical>roof</radical> <radical>child</radical> stands upon the roof, holding up a single <kanji>letter</kanji>, a single <kanji>character</kanji>, a single <kanji>symbol</kanji> for the world to see.	More people can see this character since the kid is on the roof.	"The <kanji>character</kanji> that is being shown is ""J,"" which stands for <reading>Je</reading>sus (<ja>じ</ja>). The kid wants everyone to see this <kanji>letter</kanji> and <kanji>symbol</kanji>."	"Imagine the child holding up the letter yelling at everyone who passes that the ""J"" stands for ""Jesus.""

年	Kanji	<i class=radical-gun></i>, 牛	Gun, Cow	radical, radical	Year	Year		<reading>ねん</reading>	とし			ねん	とし								The <radical>cow</radical> part of this kanji is slightly altered, but I think you can see where it is. The <radical>gun</radical> looks just fine, though. Think back to a fake memory you have living on the farm. You have your gun, and you gotta use it on a cow (ruh roh). Once a <kanji>year</kanji> on New Year's, you have to go out and shoot one of the cows. It's only a yearly shooting, though, so at least there's that respite.	"You'll have to imagine yourself doing this to remember the meaning of the kanji. Focus on the thought that ""okay... it's only once a year... I only have to do this once a <kanji>year</kanji>..."""	It is New <kanji>Years</kanji>, though, so when you bring the dead cow back home, it’s time to celebrate. Using the cow’s organs and bones, you and your siblings construct a <reading>nen</reading>doroid (<ja>ねん</ja>). Nendoroids are Japanese toys - little plastic figurines (Google it if need be). You make a little cow nendoroid holding a gun. How cute.	How funny that you use dead cow parts to make a miniature cow holding a gun much like the one you murdered earlier.

早	Kanji	日, 十	Sun, Cross	radical, radical	Early, Fast, Quick	Early, Fast, Quick		<reading>そう</reading>	はや さ			そう	はや, さ								When the <radical>sun</radical> is over the <radical>cross</radical> it's time to go to church... which is so darn <kanji>early</kanji>. And if you want to get to church early, you need to be <kanji>fast</kanji>, otherwise you'll be too late.	Imagine the sun coming up slowly, over the horizon. It then lines up with the cross, and at that moment, your alarm goes off, waking you up. You check the alarm clock, and instead of displaying the time, it just says EARLY and FAST on it, flashing in big red letters and alternating.	"To remember the <ja>そう</ja> reading we use the word ""soul.""  When you're forced to get up <kanji>fast</kanji> and <kanji>early</kanji> you can feel it in your <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). You're so tired and it's so early, your soul cries out, ""Please don't make me go this fast this early. I'm gonna leave your body if you keep this up!"""	But you get your soul up early and head to the church fast anyway, because you're doing all of this for your soul in the first place!		409	-	kanji Lesson_4

That makes sense, you wouldn't be able to see just one leaf on the sun from where you were on earth.	Imagine flying toward the sun to see a hundred leaves growing together in the shape of one big leaf. You want to go closer!	"You fly closer, counting all one <kanji>hundred</kanji> leaves when you hear a strange sound. You take off your space helmet and hear, ""GUH <reading>HYUCK</reading> (<ja>ひゃく</ja>)!""

These people are planning to take the trees and cut them down to make their <kanji>village</kanji>.	There is a whole group of people out there who are measuring these trees. Imagine them asking each other “do you think this will be a good tree for our village center?” and other people nodding in agreement or disagreement as they measure.	They take all the wood back to where they're building their <kanji>village</kanji> and once they construct the village center they paint a <reading>mura</reading>l (<ja>むら</ja>) on the side of it. The mural is of the forest where they got the tree from so they remember the building's origins.	Look at the mural on the side of this newly constructed village center. So many trees!

One man, in fact. He's running on a big wheel next to the rice paddy and providing all of the power for the rice to grow and be harvested.	Picture the power this man is generating! Now look at the next rice paddy and you'll see it's on a different power grid with a different man powering it.	A <kanji>man</kanji> can power an entire rice paddy until <reading>dawn</reading> (<ja>だん</ja>). Once dawn comes they need a little break, so they nap. But once dawn is over, they're back at it again!	Picture the man watching as the first light of dawn tints the color of the sky, turning it pink and orange.

Think about it, a single farm wouldn't need a whole street. Just paths would do. There is a street next to this rice paddy, so there must be other people, which makes this a <kanji>town</kanji>.	You go to visit this nice little <kanji>town</kanji>. But then, there she is... Every time you walk down the street, the street-woman Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>) arrives to ruin your day.	"Remember imagining Mrs. Chou in great detail in level 2? Time for some of that work to come to fruition. Imagine Mrs. Chou walking down the street of the town towards you, ready to make your day bad. She breaks things as she walks towards you, then knocks you down for walking around in her town. She says, ""Wherever there's a street, you'll find Mrs. Chou.""

It's kind of weird that the flowers radical is only a part of the flower kanji, but you'll make do. Just focus on the fact that the leader is planting all these flowers for a bigger picture thing (that's what leaders do). He wants there to be flowers for future generations as well, because he's a nice dude like that.	The leader can't stop planting <kanji>flower</kanji>s though. He's going crazy. Maybe it's the pollen? He comes up to someone named <reading>Hannah</reading> (<ja>はな</ja>) and starts planting flowers in her face, probably killing her in the process.	Do you know anyone named Hannah?

"The struggling to see bit is pretty important - make sure that you slowly see a little better and better as the person comes closer, but it's difficult the whole time (struggles are good for memory). Then, it starts to become more and more clear, and you start saying ""that can't be <reading>me</reading>. No way it's me...""

That being said, there's also another meaning you should keep in mind, which is <kanji>sufficient</kanji>. If you think about it, one foot should be <kanji>sufficient</kanji> enough to walk around with if you hop.	Same kanjis and radicals make Jack a happy boy. You should also learn the other meaning as well, though, if you can.	What do you wear on your <kanji>foot</kanji>? You wear a <reading>sock</reading> (<ja>そく</ja>).	Just think about your bare feet.

One reason you say <ja>申し申し</ja> is because it's hard for foxes to say. So, you're confirming that the other person isn't a fox. The other explanation is that operators would say this, letting the person know on the other line that they're talking by saying ""say say"" but in a humble way. Either way, this is a <vocabulary>telephone hello</vocabulary>, so say it next time you talk to someone on the phone who is Japanese... just to make sure they aren't a fox.
