甲	Radical				Turtle Shell	Turtle Shell															Poor turtles. We don't like them here. This is a <radical>turtle shell</radical>. See the shell with just a tail remaining? It's the only thing we didn't remove off the turtle. It's just a shell with a tail, so basically it's just a turtle shell.					4624	-	Lesson_30 radical
冘	Radical				Pirate	Pirate															"This kind of looks like big (<ja>大</ja>), which I think you'll remember you learned by pretending this was a big guy.

魅	Kanji	鬼, 未	Demon, Jet	radical, radical	Alluring	Alluring		<reading>み</reading>				み									A <radical>demon</radical> on a <radical>jet</radical> is pretty <kanji>alluring</kanji>. Demons themselves are pretty intriguing, but put one on a jet? Now that’s alluring.	See this demon flying around in his jet. Do you feel allured? You should. Hear the roar of the jet engine as the demon cackles.	This <kanji>alluring</kanji> demon on a jet wants one thing and one thing only. <reading>Me</reading>at (<ja>み</ja>). Human meat. This demon needs human meat to survive so he is taking his jet into the city to feast on some meat.	The demon won’t be so alluring once you see him scarfing down humans, tearing the meat from their bones. How gross.		4626	-	kanji Lesson_30

Lucky for you a <radical>tsunami</radical> is coming, so you take your spoon and use the tsunami to quench your <kanji>thirst</kanji>. You spoon the hot, hot water into your mouth as fast as you can. This is the only way to get water on the sun.	Imagine this thirst of yours. You've been in this sun prison for longer than you can remember. You've been holding onto this spoon, waiting for this moment for so long.	This method of quenching your <kanji>thirst</kanji> reminds you of being in a <reading>ca</reading>r <reading>wa</reading>sh (<ja>かわ</ja>). The water pours over you in waves, and you're stuck inside a metal cage. Totally the same thing as a car wash, right?	Imagine quenching your thirst in a real car wash.

Your clan and her clan are standing together as the two of you watch the sun rise together.	Marriage is a big deal and it's going to connect your two clans, so you have to do the ceremony in the sun in front of everyone so they can see.	For the <kanji>marriage</kanji> to be official, you need to wait for a <reading>con</reading>dor (<ja>こん</ja>) to appear. If it doesn't show up before the sun goes down again, the marriage was a failure. You have to try again tomorrow with a different woman.	Do you want to go through with this marriage? You better hope you see a condor then! It's the official bird of love and unification, ya know. That's why so many people wait until they're older to get married these days, because there aren't as many condors thanks to deforestation.		4629	-	kanji Lesson_30

The crab was the only thing standing in the way of you conquering the area. Now that the flag is in the ground, no one can dispute who it belongs to.	Look at your flag and hear it flapping in the wind. Also hear your ears ringing a bit from when you shot that crab. Look at all the bits of exploded crab strewn around the area. Yowza.	To make sure that no one removes your <kanji>flag</kanji>, you lock it to one of the lifeguard posts and you throw away the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). Since no one will have the key to unlock the flag, no one will be able to remove it.	Picture yourself locking this flag up with your key.

We don't want the earth to actually boil, but we do want some of that boiling hot sun light to illuminate all of the darkness of the universe and let us see.	The person who calls the sun asking it to <kanji>illuminate</kanji> the earth is the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>). It's very specifically the Shougun's responsibility to make sure the earth is illuminated every morning.	Picture the Shougun calling out to the sun, asking it to illuminate our planet with its boiling hot rays. You better thank the Shougun the next time you see him for everything he does for you.		4632	-	kanji Lesson_30

When you see, hear, or feel something pleasant, can't you feel that hook pressing into the middle of your body?	Imagine that feeling you get when everything is just SO pleasant. There is a pressure from your soul's hook digging in. It's a good feeling though, a pleasant one! It isn't too hard or too soft.	If you want to feel this <kanji>pleasant</kanji> feeling just look at a <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>). Kayaks are the most pleasant boats in the world.

One sided paper is just anti everything. It's bad for the environment. It's bad for easy reading. Put all those one sided papers together into one, big edition instead.	The first <kanji>edition</kanji> you create is a fan fiction all about the adventures of <reading>Han</reading> (<ja>はん</ja>) Solo. You hated how short and one sided his story in Star Wars seemed to be, and trying to keep track of it all was really hard. But not anymore!	Please read my super special Han Solo edition of the Star Wars story. I ripped out all the one sided pages that had him in it and put them into a single edition together so it's just the good stuff now.		4634	-	kanji Lesson_30

Poor people can't even afford a whole shellfish. They have to settle with just a part.	And since they are <kanji>poor</kanji>, they are getting these shellfish parts from the trash <reading>bin</reading> (<ja>びん</ja>). It's quite unfortunate.

The hills have no trees around them, so there are no leaves. The leaves are scarce here on the hills.	Imagine being on the hills. You want a leaf to find and take back as a souvenir but there are none. Imagine looking feverishly for a leaf even though you don’t really expect to find one.	Still looking for a leaf, you determine that they are far too <kanji>scarce</kanji> to find here. Just before you give up, you discover a giant <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) ball. As you pick it up, another one comes thundering down the hill knocking over a tiny tree.	Leaves are scarce here because someone is using these hills for their bowling.

While you and <kanji>the following</kanji> are <kanji>following</kanji> the feathers from their departure from the stand, one of the members of the following drops an egg and <reading>yolk</reading> (<ja>よく</ja>) spills everywhere.
