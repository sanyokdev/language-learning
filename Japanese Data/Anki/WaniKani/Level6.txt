This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb.

The only way to keep this dirt alligator from dragging you under the <kanji>earth</kanji> and eating you is to feed it <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>).

Usually you only find one or the other when you're searching.	But, you dig too deep and water flows into where you are.

Think of strange hats, funny hats, and normal hats. Just make sure you're amazed by the fact they all are wearing them.	But, as you're going through all the kings, it turns out not <kanji>all</kanji> of them have hats after all. The last one you come to does not have a hat. He is the king of <reading>Zen</reading> (<ja>ぜん</ja>) Buddhism. He has simple clothes and a shaved head, unlike all the other fancy kings standing around nearby.	"To add to this story and make it more memorable, you can imagine the other kings getting upset, saying things like ""<kanji>All</kanji> kings must wear hats! You are no king!"" The king of <reading>Zen</reading> Buddhism just ignores them and begins to meditate."		759	-	kanji Lesson_6

Where did it come from? ""Ah, it came from <kanji>yonder</kanji>,"" you say, <kanji>facing</kanji> that way."	"Yonder is a bit of a weird word, but it fits the meaning of this kanji quite well. You'll have to trust me that it's more useful in Japanese than it is in English. When you imagine through this mnemonic, make sure the drop comes from the side and hits you in the mustache with quite a bit of force. That means it came from a far distance thus making you look over ""yonder."""	Who shot this drop at you from <kanji>yonder</kanji>? You look over yonder, and see a figure. It is <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>.	"""Who is that over yonder!"" you yell. ""It is I, (<ja>こういち</ja>),"" he yells back.

She doesn't have to worry about rain or snow or finding a safe place to sleep. The roof also happened to be super <kanji>cheap</kanji>, so she can even relax about her finances.	Picture the super relaxed woman lounging under her cheap but sturdy roof. Ah, she doesn't have a care in the world!	As she <kanji>relax</kanji>es, she pulls out the <kanji>cheap</kanji>est, most relaxing food in the world <reading>an</reading>chovies (<ja>あん</ja>).	Think about it: anchovies cost next to nothing, they come in cans, you don't have to cook them or cut them up. You just munch them down. There's nothing more cheap and relaxing than eating anchovies under your own roof.		761	-	kanji Lesson_6
州	Kanji	丶, 川	Drop, River	radical, radical	State, Province, County	State, Province, County		<reading>しゅう</reading>				しゅう									Think about Japan. Japan is a country made up of islands.

These are Japan's <kanji>states</kanji> or <kanji>province</kanji>s.	Also, another way to think of this is that the river radical is actually just three rivers, separating drops, which are capitals of various states. Rivers are usually great ways to divide up a country, and states are one way to do it!	Each <kanji>state</kanji> has its own <reading>shoe</reading> (<ja>しゅう</ja>) to represent it. The bottom of each shoe is the shape of the state, so when you step it leaves a state-shaped imprint in the ground.	The state shoes also have things like the state birds, state flowers, and state fish printed on each of them. They're quite collectable, you should buy a pair for your favorite state!		762	-	kanji Lesson_6

Imagine the music coming out at you <kanji>bend</kanji>ing all around in strange shapes through the air."	The twenty mouths make so much <kanji>music</kanji> that they literally <reading>cloak you</reading> (<ja>きょく</ja>) with it. They cloak you with the music.

Everything you <kanji>have</kanji> (except the narwhal and the moon) were taken from you by a roving gang of <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>).	They came and took your things.

It's the death spoon, a sign that the yakuza is coming to cause your death.	This spoon isn't for pudding, it's for death!	<kanji>Death</kanji> comes in the form of a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>). The death sheep works for the yakuza, and kills anyone who has their spoon.	Picture the death sheep. He looks like a black shadow, and he has a scar on his face.

羊	Kanji	羊	Sheep	radical	Sheep	Sheep		<reading>よう</reading>	ひつじ			よう	ひつじ								The <radical>sheep</radical> radical and the <kanji>sheep</kanji> kanji are the same in looks as well in meaning.	You are no sheep—you study your radicals, unlike most Japanese learners. You'll learn sooo much faster!	"To remember <ja>よう</ja>, we use the word ""Yogurt."" The <kanji>sheep</kanji> are after you. There are too many of them, and they're chasing you down, stalking you... because you stole their sheep's milk <reading>yo</reading>gurt (<ja>よう</ja>).

You're scared and tired from running, but it tastes great!		767	-	kanji Lesson_6
血	Kanji	血	Blood	radical	Blood	Blood		<reading>けつ</reading>	ち			けつ	ち								The <radical>blood</radical> radical and <kanji>blood</kanji> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.	There'll be some bad blood between us if you're not studying your radicals, especially when they're the same like this kanji!	"To remember the reading <ja>けつ</ja>, we use the word ""ketsup."" The perfect mix of ketchup and catsup!  The radical is technically <radical>blood</radical>, but you know that radical is just a drop (of blood) on a plate. So, you ask yourself... Is that really blood on the plate? Could it be? You decide to take a gamble and lick it off. When you taste it, it's definitely not blood. No, it's <reading>ketsup</reading> (<ja>けつ</ja>)."

All of the small mouths come together and create a place where everyone can support each other.	Picture the capital of your country. How many mouths have come together to support each other there? A thousand? A million? More?!	To remember the reading <ja>きょう</ja> we use the Japanese city, Kyoto, which is spelled <ja><reading>きょう</reading>と</ja>. It was once the capital of Japan! It was soooo full of mouths that came together that it was the capital for a long, long time.	When you think of the capital, think of <ja>きょうと</ja>!		769	-	kanji Lesson_6

As he talks, waves extend out from him, and stop right at the border of his country before getting to the next one.	Turns out the king of this <kanji>country</kanji> loves drinking <reading>Coke</reading> (<ja>こく</ja>). Every morning that big mouth of his swallows a whole 2-liter bottle of Coke for breakfast.	Would you drink that much soda for breakfast? Now this king says he wants to pass a law requiring everyone in the country to drink nothing but Coke! That's crazy!		770	-	kanji Lesson_6

If it helps, you can come up with a reason why he's outside in the winter at night. Also, why is he wearing a lid on his head? Probably because he's protecting his people from something that comes at night.	Question is, what is he protecting them from during the <kanji>night</kanji>? Turns out, it's the <reading>Ya</reading>nkees (<ja>や</ja>) baseball team. They're out for blood, and only the leader can protect us.	Imagine the Yankees stomping towards the leader, baseball bats in hand, blood on their faces. They're here to eat, and nobody will stop them. Feel the fear of their approach.

店	Kanji	广, 占	Canopy, Fortune	radical, radical	Shop, Store	Shop, Store		<reading>てん</reading>	みせ			てん	みせ								A long time ago, someone put up a <radical>canopy</radical> over their <radical>fortune</radical> telling booth and created the first <kanji>shop</kanji>. This <kanji>store</kanji> was fortune-based, but since then lots of different stores have popped up!	Picture the very first store in history. A fortune teller decided enough was enough, they should be in some kind of structure where it's safe, official looking, and more permanent.	This <kanji>shop</kanji> quickly turned into <reading>ten</reading> (<ja>てん</ja>) shops! It was a good idea, after all, so all of the other people selling goods and services decided to copy it and create their own shops. The next day there were ten more.	Picture ten shops, all made up of someone selling something under a canopy. The first one is the fortune teller, but the nine others are whatever you want them to be!		774	-	kanji Lesson_6

With both their light-powers combined, it's incredibly <kanji>bright</kanji> outside.	Look up at both of them, hanging out in the sky together. Make them super bright, so bright you have to shield your eyes.	When do things start to get <kanji>bright</kanji> outside? I'd say when things start getting sunny, and that is the month of <reading>May</reading> (<ja>めい</ja>).	If your months don't match up with this too well (if you're down in the southern hemisphere, for example) then you'll have to imagine all this up in the Northern Hemisphere.

The sun always rises in the east, so if you head that way, past the tree, you'll be going east too.	Picture the sun behind the tree, don't picture the sun alone, you'll burn your eyes. It's slowing coming up behind it. Now think: where does the sun rise? In the east!	You walk <kanji>east</kanji> for a few hours until you finally come to a city. It's <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>. Oh! <ja>とうきょう</ja> is in the east. I get it now!	When you think about East Japan think about <ja>とうきょう</ja>.

What were you doing before you stopped here? You were <kanji>walk</kanji>ing.	"Question is, what made you stop? Imagine yourself walking at a nice casual pace... then imagine something that would make you stop that's incredibly interesting and strange. Maybe an alien is going down the slide? He would say ""keep walking, friend."""	So, you're <kanji>walk</kanji>ing around, minding your own business, when suddenly something flips up and whacks you in the face. You stepped on the head of a <reading>hoe</reading> (<ja>ほ</ja>) and it caused it to swing up from the ground and hit you.	Of course, imagine the pain of your face. Did your nose break? After bringing yourself together, look down at what hit you. It's a hoe! How did you manage to step on just the right spot to flip it up on you like that? Examine the hoe. Pay close attention to it. Whose hoe is this? etc.		777	-	kanji Lesson_6

Wait, it's not a box, this whole thing is just a <kanji>drawing</kanji>.	Look closely at this box-shaped drawing. See each little stroke, smell the paper and the lead.	The drawing seems to have something else in the rice paddy, behind the leaf. You realize the drawing is actually of a <reading>ga</reading>rgoyle (<ja>が</ja>) and a <reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>). You see the cock sitting on top of the gargoyle, crowing into the sky.	Picture the entire drawing. There's a cock sitting on a gargoyle, watching over this rice paddy. It's actually quite beautiful and idyllic.		778	-	kanji Lesson_6

This is a terrible thing you did and you need to <kanji>fix</kanji> it right now. I'll be <kanji>direct</kanji> with you, this is something you have to fix on your own.	How will you fix this mistake though? Maybe if you build a time machine you can go back and stop yourself from throwing your cross around so carelessly. Whatever you do, focus on how important it is to fix the mistake, more than anything.	As you try to <kanji>fix</kanji> the lion's eye, it starts to <reading>choke</reading> (<ja>ちょく</ja>) and make what can only be described as a <reading>jiki</reading>jikijiki sound (<ja>じき</ja>). Through its choking jikijiki sounds, it coughs up a gear. Wait. Is this a machine lion?	You're relieved! You don't know how to fix a choking, eye-stabbed lion, but you can absolutely fix a ROBOTIC one. Robots are fixable.		779	-	kanji Lesson_6
知	Kanji	矢, 口	Arrow, Mouth	radical, radical	Know	Know		<reading>ち</reading>	し			ち	し								Just before saying something important, you take an <radical>arrow</radical> to the <radical>mouth</radical> which seals your lips together, making it so you can't talk. Someone doesn't want you to share what you <kanji>know</kanji> with someone else.	Imagine being so surprised by this arrow. Then, think of all the things you know that need to be said and told to everyone. Maybe you have information about nuke codes. Maybe you have information that will save the President. Whatever it is, make sure you know important things that need to be said (but also things that people want to prevent you from saying, even if it means shooting you in the mouth with an arrow).	"To remember the reading <ja>ち</ja> we use the word ""cheese.""  One of the things you <kanji>know</kanji> is actually very strange but very important. The president's <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>) has been poisoned and only you know. If you could just say something then maybe you could save him... but... you have an arrow in your mouth."	"Try saying the words ""cheese"" with an arrow in your mouth. What would that sound like? Go ahead and pretend out loud."		780	-	kanji Lesson_6
長	Kanji	長	Long	radical	Long, Leader	Long, Leader		<reading>ちょう</reading>	なが	は		ちょう	なが, は								The <radical>long</radical> radical and the <kanji>long</kanji> kanji are the same!   This kanji also means <kanji>leader</kanji>, because the longer a person is, the better a leader they'll be. Or maybe it was... the longer they've been somewhere? Whatever, longness = leaderness, you know?	As long as you know the radical long, you know the kanji long as well.	"You see a very <kanji>long</kanji> person. It's Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>), who has made herself long, like her street. ""I made myself long so I can watch more of the street, my domain. I'm the <kanji>leader</kanji> of these streets. Watch yourself not-long person,"" says Mrs. Chou."	<kanji>Long</kanji> isn't an idea that's easy to imagine in any specific sense, but you can try some other things too, as long as it gets associated with Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading>. For the most part, when you see a kanji with the radical <ja>長</ja> the reading will be <ja>ちょう</ja>.		781	-	kanji Lesson_6
前	Kanji	<i class=radical-horns></i>, 一, 月, 刂	Horns, Ground, Moon, Knife	radical, radical, radical, radical	Front, Before	Front, Before		<reading>ぜん</reading>	まえ			ぜん	まえ								There are some <radical>horns</radical> on the <radical>ground</radical> and a <radical>moon</radical> <radical>knife</radical> in <kanji>front</kanji> of you. When you try to move, they always rotate around with you, staying right in front. You can't escape these objects, for some reason.  This kanji means <kanji>before</kanji> too. Something that's in front of you is before you, after all.	Perhaps it's some kind of magic, but you don't care. Why are these strange objects always in front of me? Why won't they stay put? This will get pretty freaky after a while. Try to run. Try to hide. Spin around. Do whatever you need to do. No matter what, these objects are always in front.	You're going crazy with these things in <kanji>front</kanji> of you all the time. You finally seek the help of a <reading>Zen</reading> (<ja>ぜん</ja>) master, who tells you that meditation will save you from this curse. You try it out, and sure enough, the objects are gone! It worked!	Go ahead and do some Zen Buddhist meditation. Maybe it'll help you to remember this kanji's reading better (and calm your mind so you're ready for the next kanji!).		782	-	kanji Lesson_6

Probably because it's warmer and less damp down south.	Look down and see the compass pointing south and feel the cross pulling you in that direction.	You finally make it down <kanji>south</kanji>, and it is dry, but you're really hungry. When you try to find southern food you realize every single store is only selling <reading>naan</reading> (<ja>なん</ja>).	Imagine being in the south and taking big bites of naan. It tastes good, but now your mouth is dry just like your horns. Too dry...		783	-	kanji Lesson_6

This is your <kanji>room</kanji>! That's really all a room is, you know? A covered, private place where you can have some time to yourself.	Imagine the room you live in now. Take away all the stuff and you're left with a roof and the dirt on the ground. It's your own little private place.	The only problem with your <kanji>room</kanji> is that you can't always be alone. Because of your dad's <reading>shih tzu</reading> (<ja>しつ</ja>). The shih tzu likes to come into your room and pee everywhere. Ruining your privacy completely.	Imagine watching the little shih tzu come into your room and lift its leg to all your things. This isn't fair. The shih tzu has its own room to pee in. Why does it have to ruin yours?		784	-	kanji Lesson_6

Imagine trying to loiter while you poop in the winter. You're just trying to take your time as you squat over the snow, but soon you hear things behind you.	You finally look <kanji>behind</kanji> you and see <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>) and a giant <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja> having a violent battle <kanji>back</kanji> there!	Godzilla and <ja>こういち</ja> were going at it behind you the entire time you were just lazily taking a poop in the snow?! Ahh, that's so embarrassing! And also dangerous, they could have crushed you!

You <kanji>think</kanji> this heart is from a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>). It's big and covered in wool. It's also baa-ing a little. Why would you think anything else?

Of course, all the other stars are probably giving life to other planets as well.	Imagine all sorts of stars all around the universe giving life to planets as suns. These are all the stars you see in the sky and there are billions of them. I hope you don't feel overwhelmed by how minuscule we really are when you look up at all of them.	This <kanji>star</kanji> (the sun) and all of the others are yours to protect with your trusty <reading>sa</reading>ber (<ja>せい</ja>). If you could protect your land from the West, then you can certainly defend the stars too!	Now you're soaring through between the stars, swinging your saber through the silence of space, and... wait.

The tongues are making you more aware of yourself and your surroundings than you've ever been. You want to dance, you want to sing, you want to live your life.	This <kanji>lively</kanji> feeling isn't just happening to you, the tongue tsunami is licking it into all of the <reading>cats</reading> (<ja>かつ</ja>) in your neighborhood too!	You and the cats are running around playing together, because you can't seem to get the lively feelings to stop.

""You better turn back, <kanji>sea</kanji>, or I'll shoot!"""	"You'll have to think of the ""sea"" as its own entity, controlling the tsunami, otherwise you might confuse and combine the two.

The <kanji>sea</kanji> decides it doesn't want to die today, so it turns its tsunami around and goes the other way. You hop in your <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>) and chase after it with your gun, to make sure it actually returns to the sea and doesn't just drown someone else.

Thank goodness, you finally get to <kanji>eat</kanji> your <kanji>meal</kanji>. You're so hungry. Someone has been starving you and now they've finally given you food. Unfortunately, though, every time you take a bite, you get a <reading>shock</reading> (<ja>しょく</ja>) from somewhere.	So, do you keep eating and keep getting shocked?

You shouldn't be sharing them with the whole town, they're just for you.  This kanji also means <kanji>I</kanji>. Why? Because what's more private than you? I mean, I! Basically, some things are only the business of you (I) and those things should be private.	Look at your private grains. Who are those for? Why, they're for I!	You're getting into the zone, thinking about yourself (<kanji>I</kanji>) and how much you love having things that are <kanji>private</kanji> and just yours, when you realize there is a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>) in this grain bag. And it's eating all of your (I's) private grains. No!	The moral of the story is: don't let a sheep sneak into your private stash of things just for you (I).

You know the kun'yomi reading of <ja>足</ja> from previous vocab and you know the kun'yomi reading of <ja>首</ja> from learning that kanji. So, you should be able to read this kanji so long as you remember that it's all kun'yomi.		[sound:39601-subject-2925.mp3][sound:19689-subject-2925.mp3]	879	-	Lesson_6 Vocabulary
首になる	Vocabulary	首	Neck	kanji	To Get Fired, To Get Sacked	To Get Fired, To Get Sacked, To Be Sacked, To Be Fired					<reading>くびになる</reading>	くびになる		Expression, Godan Verb	先月、会社を首になりました。	I was fired from the company last month.	しゅう金したお金をつかいこんだら、首になるに決まってるじゃん！	Of course you would get fired, if you used up the collected money.	マーチングバンドを職場に引き連れてきたことが理由で、私は昨日首になりました。	I got sacked yesterday for bringing a marching band into work with me.	"The <ja>になる</ja> part means ""to become,"" so literally this means ""to become neck."" If you think about it, when something becomes neck, it has to do with you getting your head cut off (at the neck). But, in today's modern society we don't do that too often. Instead, this means you lose your job, aka <vocabulary>to get fired</vocabulary>."		This word contains the reading you learned with the kanji. Everything else is hiragana.

亡くなる	Vocabulary	亡	Death	kanji	To Pass Away, To Become Deceased, To Die	To Pass Away, To Become Deceased, To Die					<reading>なくなる</reading>	なくなる		Intransitive Verb, Godan Verb	まつ本さんが、亡くなったそうです。	I heard that Matsumoto passed away.	わたしの妹は、五才のときに、はいえんで亡くなりました。	My younger sister died of pneumonia when she was five.	もし母さんが亡くなったら、僕の料理を作ってくれる人がいなくなってしまう。	If my mom passes away, the person who makes food for me will be gone.	"This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <ja>う</ja> sound, you know this word is a verb. This word is actually two words put together, though. <ja>亡く</ja> means ""be deceased."" <ja>なる</ja> means ""to become."" So put that all together and you have <vocabulary>to pass away</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>to become deceased</vocabulary>. It's basically a polite way to say something died (<ja>死ぬ</ja>)."		To learn to read this kanji you have to remember the <ja>な</ja> part of <ja>亡く</ja>, though our mnemonic will use the whole thing.  If you're about to become deceased, you are probably <reading>knock</reading>ing (<ja>なく</ja>) on death's door.		[sound:39463-subject-3406.mp3][sound:19558-subject-3406.mp3]	881	-	Lesson_6 Vocabulary

Is it really? Are you crazy?	"You know that <ja>文字</ja> means ""letters"". So, what are ""small letters""? That would be <vocabulary>lowercase letters</vocabulary>."		"The reading for <ja>小</ja> is an exceptional reading. You know it means ""small,"" so think about what else is small: a child. How do you say ""child"" in Japanese? <ja>こ</ja>.

冬休み	Vocabulary	冬, 休	Winter, Rest	kanji, kanji	Winter Holiday, Winter Break, Winter Vacation	Winter Holiday, Winter Break, Winter Vacation					<reading>ふゆやすみ</reading>	ふゆやすみ		Noun	冬休みに、かぞくで山の中のホテルにとまりました。	During winter break my family stayed in a hotel in the mountains.	冬休みは子どもたちがいえで兄弟げんかばっかりしていて大へんでした。	Winter holiday was pretty tough because my sons fight so often at home.	冬休みは、毎日一日中ジョギングをしていました。	During winter vacation, I jogged everyday, all day long.	The <kanji>winter</kanji> <kanji>rest</kanji>! Wait, nobody calls it that. This is a <vocabulary>winter holiday</vocabulary> or <vocabulary>winter break</vocabulary>.		The readings for these are both the kun'yomi readings. Hopefully you learned them when you were doing vocab in the previous levels so that all you have to do now is combine the two separate words into one bigger word. Please don't take a winter break until you figure this word out.		[sound:39615-subject-3415.mp3][sound:19709-subject-3415.mp3]	883	-	Lesson_6 Vocabulary

Can you do that, too?	When you <kanji>exit</kanji> and <kanji>come</kanji>, apparently it means <vocabulary>to be able to do</vocabulary>. I think of it like you're leaving a location (<ja>出</ja>) to do a task and then you come (<ja>来る</ja>) back after you did it. Perhaps you were waiting in a room training like someone from Dragonball. When you leave the room, you are ready to fight the enemy and win. You train in that room <vocabulary>to be able to do</vocabulary> whatever you need to do, and only leave and come back alive because you were able to do it.		The readings are a bit strange. Both kun'yomi, where <ja>出</ja> is <ja>で</ja> and <ja>来る</ja> is <ja>きる</ja>. This is different from the reading you learned with <ja>来る</ja> (<ja>くる</ja>), though, so be careful. If you can remember that and remember the kun'yomi readings from the previous vocab, you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.

My boyfriend's dialect has rubbed off on me.	私の国の東側出身の人達は変わった方言で喋るので、彼らが何を言っているのか全く分かりません。	People from the eastern part of my country use such an odd dialect that they are impossible to understand.	"The <kanji>way</kanji> you <kanji>say</kanji> things could be translated as your accent... but this is much bigger. This is an entire ""way"" of speaking. This is a <vocabulary>dialect</vocabulary>.   You can even think of the <ja>方</ja> as being ""direction"" where you go in different directions in a country and discover different dialects, if that way of thinking helps."		This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.		[sound:39609-subject-3419.mp3][sound:19696-subject-3419.mp3]	885	-	Lesson_6 Vocabulary

When you have a <kanji>fast</kanji> <kanji>mouth</kanji>, you're probably a <vocabulary>fast talker</vocabulary>, right motormouth?		Remember how body parts often change even jukugo words to kun'yomi readings? That's what happened here too. Both readings are kun'yomi, making this one <ja><reading>はやくち</reading></ja>.
