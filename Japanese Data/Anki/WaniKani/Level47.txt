砕	Kanji	石, 九, 十	Stone, Nine, Cross	radical, radical, radical	Smash	Smash		<reading>さい</reading>	くだ			さい	くだ								Take this <radical>stone</radical> and throw it at <radical>nine</radical> <radical>cross</radical>es to <kanji>smash</kanji> them! It's like old-fashioned bowling, but instead of rolling this stone to knock down the crosses, you want to completely smash them to bits!	Picture the nine crosses in front of you, lined up in a triangle. Now take your rock, hold it above your head, and SMASH it down on them as hard as you can!!	As you <kanji>smash</kanji> these crosses, you think of your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>) and how much you want to smash the people who took it away from you. Your cyborg was so good at smashing things too. You could be smashing together, if you didn't have to sell it.	You smash things because your own heart has been smashed by your cyborg. :'(		7117	-	kanji Lesson_47
粘	Kanji	米, 占	Rice, Fortune	radical, radical	Sticky	Sticky		<reading>ねん</reading>	ねば			ねん	ねば								Your <radical>rice</radical> <radical>fortune</radical> is <kanji>sticky</kanji>. Rice is sticky. So is your rice fortune. Your fortune of rice is sticky because it is made up entirely of sticky rice.	Look at this sticky rice fortune of yours. Run your hands through it and feel the sticky rice between your fingers. Hear the sticky sucking sounds and you stir the sticky rice about.	This rice is so <kanji>sticky</kanji> that you are able to sculpt <reading>nen</reading>doroids (<ja>ねん</ja>) from it. Your rice fortune is worth even more now that you are hand making limited edition nendoroids from it.	Imagine sculpting these sticky rice nendoroids with your bare hands. Feel the sticky rice between your fingers as you smush the rice into cute little nendoroids.		7118	-	kanji Lesson_47

Imagine mixing dirt and rice together to make some cosmetics that best fit your skin tone and type. No one will see you doing it under this canopy too, so the secret formula you come up with will be safe.	You need these <kanji>cosmetics</kanji> because you have a meeting with the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) coming up. You want to impress him, and you don't want anyone to copy your look.	Imagine meeting the Shougun with your new cosmetics all over your face. You look amazing! Stunning! The shougun wants to know where you got that foundation, you're glowing!		7119	-	kanji Lesson_47

Lying, stealing, faking things—no type of deceit is too much for a crab.	Covering things up with deceit is pretty much the worst thing you can do, so don't be like this crab.	<kanji>Deceit</kanji> can only take you so far, and soon the crab is caught, tried for its crimes and coverups, and sentenced to death via <reading>gui</reading>llotine (<ja>ぎ</ja>).	"Picture the crab with its head, er, front half? Whatever, it's in the guillotine and it's screaming, ""You've been deceived! I never deceived anyone, you're all sheep!"""		7120	-	kanji Lesson_47

They say that if you believe your own lie, others will believe it as well. This is key.	Imagine an actual key going from you to another person. This key is the lie. You gotta believe in the lie for it to reach the other person and unlock their understanding. Visualize this visual lie.	The <kanji>lie</kanji> you told was about not stealing your buddy’s <reading>saw</reading> (<ja>さ</ja>). You actually did steal his saw. He saw you steal his saw, but now you are trying to lie your way out of it. It’s not going well.	Imagine trying to lie your way out of this. He saw you steal his saw. He caught you red handed.

When the warm rain hits your cold, winter spear, it creates <kanji>fog</kanji>.	When warm water touches a cold spear, fog billows out and covers everything.	Through the <kanji>fog</kanji> you see the shape of a mythical <reading>kiri</reading>n (<ja>きり</ja>). You can only see the outline through the fog, but you know it's there.	You walk toward the kirin through the fog. When you get close, the image before you becomes clear: it's two cans of Kirin beer on a slide.  Next time you see fog, keep your eyes peeled for the real kirin in the kiri.		7122	-	kanji Lesson_47
柳	Kanji	木, 卩	Tree, Stamp	radical, radical	Willow	Willow		<reading>りゅう</reading>	やなぎ			りゅう	やなぎ								A <radical>tree</radical> that is <radical>stamp</radical>ed with one pattern, then <radical>stamp</radical>ed with another pattern, over and over, is the <kanji>willow</kanji> tree. 	A willow tree is a tree that looks like it's on repeat over and over again. It also looks nice on a stamp. Note that the first stamp is kind of an ugly looking backwards stamp, and the second stamp is the normal stamp radical.	<reading>Ryu</reading> (<ja>りゅう</ja>) from Street Fighter really loves <kanji>willow</kanji> trees. Ryu loves them so much that he makes out with them. Ryu is open mouth kissing a willow tree. You are watching this. It is happening.	Watch Ryu as he French kisses this willow tree. Hear him slurping and moaning in ecstasy. Why are you watching this? This is gross. Wait – is this turning you on!? Ew.		7123	-	kanji Lesson_47

Wolverine’s leader is Professor X, and they are both sliding down a big slide to Italy. How fun!	Imagine Wolverine and his leader Professor X going down this slide to Italy. Hear them wooping and cheering as they ride down the slide. Whee~	Before Professor X can get off the slide into <kanji>Italy</kanji>, a large <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) swoops down and plucks him right out of his wheelchair. That eagle is very strong. Goodbye, Professor X!	Imagine this eagle carrying Professor X away from Italy and out over the ocean. You can also remember this reading easily because Italy starts with the letter I. Super simple stuff.		7124	-	kanji Lesson_47
佐	Kanji	ｲ, ナ, 工	Leader, Narwhal, Construction	radical, radical, radical	Help	Help		<reading>さ</reading>				さ									The <radical>leader</radical> of a <radical>narwhal</radical> <radical>construction</radical> crew needs all the <kanji>help</kanji> he can get. The narwhals are beginning construction on an underwater city. The leader knows the narwhals are hard construction workers, but they’ll need some help building this city.	Imagine being the narwhal leader and asking others for help. Ask a shark for help. Ask a whale for help. Ask a shrimp for help. Go on, ask.	Then you discover a <reading>saw</reading> (<ja>さ</ja>) who would be a great big <kanji>help</kanji>. This saw is very strong and would help you and your narwhal construction team out a lot. You should make use of this saw right away.	Imagine using this saw and realizing how big of a help it is. Hear the saw sawing away as you and your fellow narwhals get to work.		7125	-	kanji Lesson_47
尺	Kanji	尺	Shrimp	radical	Shaku, Japanese Foot	Shaku, Japanese Foot		<reading>しゃく</reading>				しゃく									This <radical>shrimp</radical> is the exact length of a <kanji>shaku</kanji>, or <kanji>Japanese foot</kanji>. That’s how they came up with this form of measurement. They measured the length of this shrimp and it was the length of a Japanese foot which they deemed the shaku. It’s equal to 30.3cm, very close to one imperial foot.	Imagine this foot long shrimp. It’s pretty big. Imagine it squirming about making a “shaku shaku” sound as it worms about.	How is <kanji>shaku</kanji>, the <kanji>Japanese foot</kanji>, pronounced by <reading>Shaq</reading> (<ja>しゃく</ja>) in Japanese? Why Shaq pronounces it shaku. It’s pronounced shaku in both English and Japanese.	Imagine Shaq dribbling the shrimp like a basketball, saying “shaku, shaku, shaku” every time he bounces the shrimp.		7126	-	kanji Lesson_47

You kick the lid, even though it is your fault that you hit yourself in the mouth with it. It’s not the lid’s fault. You don’t need to kick it. You’re being pathetic.	Imagine kicking this lid and with each kick you feel a little bit more pathetic. Your mouth hurts a lot too.	You kick the lid one last time and it bounces off the wall and hits you in the <reading>eye</reading> (<ja>あい</ja>). How <kanji>pathetic</kanji>. You are a pathetic mess. You should have never kicked the lid. Now both your eye and your mouth are in pain, you pathetic fool, you.	Hold your eye with one hand and your mouth with the other.

Before the landslide, you just had a wide open mouth hole.	Picture your mouth as an open hole. Now a landslide of something (words? food? something worse?) comes pouring out, and when it's done you have lips. You flap them open and closed to test them out.	Now you can use your new <kanji>lips</kanji> to enjoy a nice, cold <reading>Kuchi beer</reading> (<ja>くちびる</ja>). The Kuchi people are Afghan Pashtun nomads. They are lesser known for their amazing beer. And you've never been able to get this delicious beer into your mouth, but now that you have lips you can get it all in there.	Imagine wrapping your new lips around the mouth of this Kuchi beer bottle. It's so good! And you aren't spilling any of it!		7128	-	kanji Lesson_47

It's a little weird looking, but these things are definitely supposed to fence something in.	Can you see the fence made of horns and flags through the light of the lantern?	You want to know what this <kanji>fence</kanji> is fencing in, so you take a step closer. As the light from the lantern gets brighter you see that the fence is around a ton of <reading>hay</reading> (<ja>へい</ja>).	Picture yourself climbing over this fence (that you're definitely not supposed to climb based on all these flags and horns) and falling into the piles of hay. It's a little scratchy, but otherwise pretty comfy!		7129	-	kanji Lesson_47

This makes a loud <kanji>crash</kanji> sound. I mean, how could it not? The building literally crashed to the ground when the horned pig attacked it.	Picture a pig with horns crashing into a building and both of them crashing into the dirt. Uh oh, is the pig dead?	"You're worried about the pig, that was a pretty big <kanji>crash</kanji>, after all. So you yell, ""<reading>SOOEY</reading> (<ja>つい</ja>)!"" Here pig pig pig. SOOEEEYYY! You know—the universal call for pigs"	"Imagine walking around the crash site yelling ""Sooey! Sooey!"" over and over.

Imagine someone's putting a woman's mouth over your mouth, looking at you, and commenting on your likeness. All it took was this woman's mouth.	You have a <kanji>likeness</kanji> to <reading>Jo</reading>-Anne (<ja>じょ</ja>) when you wear that mouth.	Jo-Anne popped her mouth off and put it on you.

婆	Kanji	波, 女	Wave, Woman	radical, radical	Old Woman	Old Woman		<reading>ば</reading>	ばあ			ば	ばあ								A <radical>wave</radical> crashes into a <radical>woman</radical>, transforming her into an <kanji>old woman</kanji>! The wave washes away all of the woman’s makeup, revealing her to be an old woman. The makeup she had on made her appear to be a much younger woman, but once the wave washed away her makeup, she was revealed for the old woman she is.	Imagine a gorgeous woman. Now see her get hit by a wave of water and turn into an old woman. The old woman could still be pretty too, she just looks way old now. Like ancient.	In an attempt to distract you from the fact that she is actually an <kanji>old woman</kanji>, the old woman starts to <reading>baa</reading> (<ja>ば</ja>) and act like a sheep. The old woman goes “Baa! Baa!” and hops around on all fours like a sheep.	Imagine this old woman acting like a sheep, just saying “baa” over and over and over again. Baa! Baa! Baa!		7132	-	kanji Lesson_47
崖	Kanji	山, 厂, 土	Mountain, Cliff, Dirt	radical, radical, radical	Cliff	Cliff		<reading>がい</reading>	がけ			がい	がけ								There is a <radical>mountain</radical> on top of a bunch of <radical>dirt</radical> with a steep <radical>cliff</radical>. This is a bit redundant, but the mountain and the dirt just make the <kanji>cliff</kanji> even bigger and steeper and scarier.	Imagine a cliff. Now add two big helpings of dirt and a mountain to the top. It's still a cliff, it's just more cliff than before.	"As you’re peering over this tall <kanji>cliff</kanji>, somebody behind you shouts, “Hey, <reading>guy</reading> (<ja>がい</ja>)!” This startles you and you tumble down the cliff. Apparently so did he, because you can hear him saying, ""Hey guy! OOF! Are you okay? OOF! Guy? Guy!!!” as you both fall."	"Imagine falling down this huge cliff and the last words you have to hear before you splat on the ground is someone yelling ""Guy"" at you over and over. What a way to go."		7133	-	kanji Lesson_47

You've invented... the <kanji>hat</kanji>!	A hat is just a piece of cloth or a towel you get to stay on your head. Extra points if it protect your eyes from the sun.	People see you wearing this fancy new <kanji>hat</kanji> thing and start asking you to share. You grab all your extra towels, roll them up, and <reading>bow</reading>l (<ja>ぼう</ja>) them down the street toward everyone who asks for one.	Imagine bowling with hats. Thankfully, they work as bowling balls just as well as they work as hats. You're so innovative!		7134	-	kanji Lesson_47
幣	Kanji	敝, 巾	Penguin, Towel	radical, radical	Cash	Cash		<reading>へい</reading>				へい									That <radical>penguin</radical> over there seems to have a <radical>towel</radical> stuffed with <kanji>cash</kanji>.	The towel the cash is in even has a big $ on it like the ones they have at the bank. You follow the penguin into a back alley.	Your eyes follow the <kanji>cash</kanji>, and you watch as the penguin stuffs it, towel and all, into a <reading>hay</reading> (<ja>へい</ja>) stack. What a smart penguin, people don't look for cash in hay, they're too busy looking for needles.	You wait for the penguin to leave and you run over to the hay stack and stick your hand in. But you don't feel the towel or the cash! Instead you pull out your hand and it's full of hay and needles. Ouch! No fair, gimme that cash!!		7135	-	kanji Lesson_47
恨	Kanji	忄, 艮	Soul, Root	radical, radical	Grudge	Grudge		<reading>こん</reading>	うら			こん	うら								A <radical>soul</radical> will only inhabit a <radical>root</radical> if it's holding a <kanji>grudge</kanji>. Have you ever seen a nice, haunted tree? No! They're always angry and trying to get someone back for something.	Don't die with a grudge, or your soul might end up angry and trapped in some roots.	If you see one of these <kanji>grudge</kanji> trees, it's probably inhabited by the soul of a <reading>con</reading>dor (<ja>こん</ja>). Humans tend to kill condors and take their trees away to build houses and make toilet paper. So condors hold pretty bad grudges against us, and so their souls end up stuck in a lot of trees.	Picture a tree with the soul of a condor with a grudge in it before you. You feel bad about being so wasteful with paper and chopsticks now, huh?		7136	-	kanji Lesson_47
憎	Kanji	忄, 曽	Soul, Mask	radical, radical	Hate	Hate		<reading>ぞう</reading>	にく			ぞう	にく								The <radical>soul</radical> <radical>mask</radical> helps you to see the deepest part of anyone's soul. You look around and in all the people you only see <kanji>hate</kanji>.	You're supposed to see all the emotions, so why do you only see hate inside everyone?	It turns out you're not looking at normal people. You see so much <kanji>hate</kanji> because all the people you're looking at are actually just a group of <reading>zo</reading>mbies (<ja>ぞう</ja>).	Zombies are pretty filled with hate, so it makes sense that you'd see a bunch of hate if you used the soul mask on them.		7137	-	kanji Lesson_47

You’ve been talking and moving your tongue around all day expressing your feelings. This has tired both your tongue and your heart out, so you stop your tongue moving and decide that you need some self rest time.	It's important to let yourself rest every now and then, you know.	What better way to <kanji>rest</kanji> than to eat some cake (<ja>けい</ja>)! No talking necessary. Just enjoy the delicious taste of cake on your tongue and feel your heart let out a sigh of relief.

Now hold on, you may be thinking, wouldn't they go for the back door? No! 99% of home invasions happen when you leave your own front door unlocked!	You better check the locks on your front door right now, because odds are you left it open and didn't even notice. It's the perfect door for a criminal to get access to your home.	To protect your <kanji>front door</kanji> from criminals you plan to fill it with <reading>hea</reading>t (<ja>ひ</ja>). Oh yeah, we're gonna Kevin McCallister this.

"You <kanji>insert</kanji> one finger, it burns up immediately, and its <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>) comes flying out screaming for a moment before it disappears. Hmm. You insert another finger and as it burns up, another little soul comes out screeching, ""WHY WOULD YOU INSERT ME IN THERE!"" and is gone."

You and the Shougun have grown pretty close over the last year or so, and this Viking is going to take advantage!
