寛	Kanji	宀, 艹, 見	Roof, Flowers, See	radical, radical, radical	Tolerance	Tolerance		<reading>かん</reading>	くつろ			かん	くつろ								The <radical>roof</radical> <radical>flowers</radical> <radical>see</radical> everything. But, they only see. That is because they learned the art of <kanji>tolerance</kanji>.	These roof flowers only see because they do not judge. They accept everything. We humans can learn a thing or two about tolerance from these roof flowers.	<kanji>Tolerance</kanji> is one thing that Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>) had a surprising amount of.	You wouldn't expect it, but he actually allowed many types of cultures, religions, and peoples to exist under his reign. The Mongols had an exceptional amount of tolerance for the time.		7915	-	kanji Lesson_53
胞	Kanji	月, 包	Moon, Wrap	radical, radical	Cell, Placenta	Cell, Placenta		<reading>ほう</reading>				ほう									Take the <radical>moon</radical> and <radical>wrap</radical> it in a bag and it will look just like a <kanji>cell</kanji>. It's a circle in a bigger circle. The moon is the nucleus. Yes! Science is happening!	Picture the moon with a big bag circling it. Now look down at your biology homework on cells. They're identical!	As you learn about <kanji>cell</kanji>s you realize they're all over your <reading>ho</reading>me (<ja>ほう</ja>). Without ever noticing it, your home has been slowly filling with dead skin cells. And now that you know what they look like (the moon with a plastic wrap bag around it) you can see them everywhere.	AHHH CLEAN ALL OF THESE CELLS OUT OF YOUR HOME!		7916	-	kanji Lesson_53

All buildings have at least one scooter. It could be out front, on the roof, in the basement. But all of them have scooters and someone who likes to ride them instead of using a car or a bike.	<kanji>All</kanji> of these scooters have a specific sound they make as they burst out of the buildings: <reading>zuwee</reading> (<ja>ずい</ja>).

Some teachers want papers to be a certain number of words or pages, but that's silly. You should measure your draft in grains!	Imagine holding your draft up outside in a field of grains. You're a couple leaves short. Time to get back to the drawing board.	Who asked you to write such a tall <kanji>draft</kanji> in the first place? Emperor <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>, who wants you to draft up the world's largest book about how great of an emperor he is.	Now <ja>こういち</ja> is out there measuring your draft against the tall grain plants. You better hope it's long enough, because if it isn't, Emperor <ja>こういち</ja>'s probably going to execute you. 		7918	-	kanji Lesson_53
丹	Kanji	舟	Boat	radical	Rust Colored, Red, Sincerity 	Rust Colored, Red, Sincerity 		<reading>たん</reading>	に			たん	に								This is a <radical>boat</radical>, but it's missing some pieces. That's because it's really rusty, so parts are falling off of it and it looks <kanji>rust colored</kanji>. In ancient Chinese literature, this rusty red color represented <kanji>sincerity</kanji>, and you'll often see this kanji take that meaning in jukugo words. 	Picture this broken, rust colored boat. It's a reddish-brown color and it's definitely missing some important pieces.	The <kanji>rust colored</kanji> boat has inspired you, so you sit down next to it in the sun and <reading>tan</reading> (<ja>たん</ja>). You want to be the exact same rust color as the boat, and in a few hours you're sure you'll match.	Watch your skin slowly change as you tan to match the rust colored boat. Feel your skin in the sun.

When nursed, dirt becomes <kanji>soil</kanji>.	Soil generally has more nutrients in it. It makes sense for dirt that's been nursed to become soil.	<kanji>Soil</kanji> is a thing <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>) the huge farmhand works on improving. If he makes the soil better, the farm will yield more crops.	Imagine Jourm working with soil (not dirt!). Improving it by mixing in various ingredients. The soil this year is particularly lush, for some reason...		7920	-	kanji Lesson_53

Only when there is a <kanji>surplus</kanji> can you put that much grain in your mouth.	Imagine seeing so much grain that you can stuff your mouth so full you can't swallow or spit it out. You have to use a knife to remove it. After you get all the grain out, comment on the surplus of grain.	The <kanji>surplus</kanji> is thanks to the hard work of folks like <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>) the big farmhand. He worked hard to make sure there was a surplus of grain this year.	Remember how Jourm made the soil better? Perhaps this is some of that work paying off. Thanks to that and everything else, there is a great surplus.		7921	-	kanji Lesson_53

Anything less than a tsunami of conflict would leave something behind. But this much conflict will cleanse the area of everything.	"The <kanji>cleanse</kanji> of your lands was caused by <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>). Why did the slow farmhand bring an army to the village, and why is he yelling about, ""The cleanse,"" while destroying everything? Jourm?! Weren't we friends?"	"You thought Jourm was an ordinary, clumsy, ten foot tall farmhand. But he brought down a tsunami upon your village. And, he brought armed conflict too. This thing he calls ""The cleanse"" was actually something he had been planning for years. His use of a totally ordinary Viking mouth towel... his table made of foreheads... That tatami mat altar with the forehead wearing a top hat... Was he really a Viking pretending to be a simple farmhand just so he could bring his men inland to cleanse and purify your village? It's too late now. Jourm stands over your body. You are about to receive ""The cleanse"" too."		7922	-	kanji Lesson_53

This shop is the only place you can buy everything you need. It's not like you can make a cottage from scratch!	Picture yourself walking into the cottage wedding shop. Look at all the different cottages you get to choose from. And there's wedding cake too?! This shop has everything!	You're browsing everything in the <kanji>shop</kanji> when a garden <reading>hoe</reading> (<ja>ほ</ja>) catches your eye. Yes. This will make your cottage wedding the absolute best one. The hoe will give you away at your wedding.	Imagine walking around the shop and then falling in love with a hoe with pretty tassels and flowers attached to it. Yes, it's only for decoration, but you're going to buy and use it during your cottage wedding.		7923	-	kanji Lesson_53

No one would listen to him during the day, so he waited for the moon to rise so he could complain about prices doing the same.	"Picture the gladiator riding his horse in the light of the moon yelling, ""Do you have any idea how important it is to increase the average pay rate to account for inflation? All of us gladiators are going to be unable to pay the bills soon because inflation isn't being taken into account! You'll suffer too! Listen to me!"""	<kanji>Inflation</kanji> rises the most in <ja><reading>とう</reading>きょう</ja>, and the gladiator knows that because that's where most of them live and fight (and die).	Imagine if you were in this gladiator's place. In five years, you wouldn't be able to afford to eat thanks to the bosses in <ja>とうきょう</ja> refusing to adjust for inflation.

Why thread? Back in the old days globes were sewn together with cloth and thread, so there was a literal thread dividing the Koreas!  Or you can just picture an actual, super long piece of thread going around the entire globe. That works too.	The only way you can see this <kanji>latitude</kanji> line is to ride an <reading>ea</reading>gle (<ja>い</ja>) over it. The line isn't visible from a car, you're too close, and a plane is too high. You have to see it from an eagle's point of view.

That's why his boat is a <kanji>rowboat</kanji>, so he can work on his yoga arms as he gets around.	Picture the Yoga King rowing a rowboat. Maybe he's using his legs. Maybe he's using his butt? You don't know. Yoga people are super flexible, he could be using anything to move this rowboat.	As he rows the <kanji>rowboat</kanji> with his butt, you see the Yoga King eating something with his toes. They're <reading>ta</reading>ter tots (<ja>てい</ja>). Tater tots are the perfect snack for a rowboat. They're small, delicious, and they float if you drop them in the water.	Go rent a rowboat and try eating tater tots in it.

This is pretty gross, but sometimes it's more important that you expose the cause of the problem, than avoiding something uncomfortable.	Close your eyes. Picture someone's arm. Now touch their skin with your fingers and peel it back to expose the muscles and bones underneath.	You <kanji>expose</kanji> a small hole under their skin and <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>) comes pouring out. Aha! You knew there was something wrong under here.

Try to actually picture the gold and white patterns you want on there. If you're a crafter, actually do it!	You want to keep your <kanji>brocade</kanji> fabrics safe, so you lock them away and seal them in with a <reading>niche key</reading> (<ja>にしき</ja>). It's niche because brocade is a very niche kind of thing.	Imagine using your niche key to open this hidden brocade storage room.

You add more ice, and it stays the same. Only some of it will freeze. What the heck!	Imagine covering a turkey in ice and every time you check it, it's only semi frozen. It doesn't matter what you do, it just refuses to freeze all the way through.	Finally you realize it will only <kanji>semi</kanji> freeze because it's <reading>June</reading> (<ja>じゅん</ja>)! It's too hot out for your turkey to freeze all the way. The ice keeps melting off the top and semi thawing it!	The lesson is to never try to freeze something in June.

The best way to separate the fibers of thread is to get a drunkard to do it. If you're too precise it will just snap. You gotta be loose with it! Just flop them onto the spikes and the fibers will come apart by themselves!	Imagine a drunkard crossing threads onto spikes and pulling the tiny fibers free. You don't think you could do that. Maybe if you got drunk too...	You stare at the <kanji>fiber</kanji>s easily coming apart when you realize that this drunkard seems to have a few extra legs... and hair and a tail? This isn't just a drunk guy, it's a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<ja>せん</ja>). Maybe separating fibers is really a centaur trick, and that's why normal people can't do it...

It was made to destroy planets, after all, so I don't know why you'd expect it to have anything nice to say. It just admonishes you about everything you've ever done wrong until you can't stop crying.	Imagine being admonished by the Death Star. It's hovering above you, giant and round, just yelling at you about everything you've ever messed up. It's really awful being yelled at. But the Death Star doing it is particularly scary and embarrassing.	"Right now you're being <kanji>admonish</kanji>ed about living in a <reading>yu</reading>rt (<ja>ゆ</ja>). The Death Star bellows, ""What, am I too big and safe for you? I'm easy to move too, you know. You're a disgrace! You should be ashamed!"""

Have you ever gotten a hair in your eye or your mouth that you just couldn't get out? You cough, your eyes water, it's awful! You can't focus on anything until it's gone. Now imagine if a big 'ol hair got stuck in your own private soul!!! Disaster!!!	This disaster is ruining your life. You can't eat, sleep, all you can do is panic trying to get the hair out.	This <kanji>disaster</kanji> is so huge that even <reading>San</reading>ta-san (<ja>さん</ja>) left his vacation in <reading>Zan</reading>zibar (<ja>ざん</ja>) to come tell you you're on the naughty list for being such a disaster person.

Imagine being a tiger or a wolverine or a tiger-wolverine and being oppressed by the government just because you're different. Imagine being stuck in a cage. Not being allowed to vote. It's awful!	Tiger and wolverine people are so <kanji>oppress</kanji>ed that the only thing they're allowed to amuse themselves with is <reading>Gak</reading> (<ja>ぎゃく</ja>). You know, that weird goo they made us play with when we were kids? Well that's not so fun when it's all you have.

Imagine reaching out and grabbing onto the old flag with your fingers. Feel the dirty grime and little holes it's gotten. Now install something new!	You've decided to <kanji>install</kanji> a <reading>su</reading>it (<ja>す</ja>) where the old flag used to be. I mean, a suit is probably more durable than a flag, am I right?
