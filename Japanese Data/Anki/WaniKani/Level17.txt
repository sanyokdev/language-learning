吉	Radical				Good Luck	Good Luck, Longcat															This is the samurai radical on top of the mouth radical. If you get to hear what a samurai says, you'll have really <radical>good luck</radical>. Samurai are pretty hard to find nowadays, which is probably why my luck has been so bad...					2604	-	Lesson_17 radical
虍	Radical				Tiger	Tiger															You lost seven toes on a cliff, but you consider yourself lucky considering you got them taken off by the cliff <radical>tiger</radical> that lives in the area. Imagine a tiger taking your seven toes as you hang off the edge of a cliff if it helps. Exciting! (And also painful!)					2605	-	Lesson_17 radical

兑	Radical				Guard	Guard															This radical is made up of horns and older brother. But those aren't really horns, they're a part of your older brother's new <radical>guard</radical> uniform.

悲	Kanji	非, 心	Criminal, Heart	radical, radical	Sad	Sad		<reading>ひ</reading>	かな			ひ	かな								A <radical>criminal</radical>'s <radical>heart</radical> will always be <kanji>sad</kanji>. No one chooses a life of crime if they're happy. And even if they seem like they're doing fine on the outside, deep down they're really sad.	Imagine watching a criminal after he's done stealing from a bank. He's all alone. He stops throwing the money around. And cries. So so sad.	The <kanji>sad</kanji> feelings fill the criminal's body with <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>). This heat spreads and radiates out. If you walk next to them on the street, you'll feel the sad heat floating by you.	Imagine being so sad that your entire body fills with heat. That heat even makes squiggly heat lines pop out above and around you.		2609	-	kanji Lesson_17

And because of your mouth drum your rejoicing will be loud and booming!	Imagine having a drum in your mouth and rejoicing about it! Imagine how loud it would be!	You loudly <kanji>rejoice</kanji> for a while when suddenly someone runs over and shoves a <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) in your mouth, locking it shut. You can't rejoice anymore! You need that key to unlock your mouth!	Imagine if people could just stop the rejoicing of others by locking their mouths shut with keys. What a sad world.		2610	-	kanji Lesson_17
原	Kanji	原	Original	radical	Original, Fundamental, Field	Original, Fundamental, Field		<reading>げん</reading>	はら			げん	はら								The <radical>original</radical> radical and the <kanji>original</kanji> kanji are the same!  This kanji can also mean <kanji>field</kanji>, probably because that's what everything originally looked like before humans: just a bunch of fields.	Know your radicals! I shouldn't even have to tell you this by now.	"The <kanji>original</kanji> Japanese hero was <reading>Gen</reading>ji (<ja>げん</ja>), from ""The Tale of Genji."""	Picture Genji, the original Japanese protagonist, walking through the streets. He's signing his name for swooning ladies and gentlemen. Genji is the OG (original Genji).		2611	-	kanji Lesson_17

Imagine a rice paddy that's as thin as a piece of thread. You'd maybe be able to get one line of rice in there? Seems very inefficient.	This <kanji>thin</kanji> rice paddy is for your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>). You only gave your cyborg a really thin strip of human stomach, so it only needs a thin line of rice to eat.	Picture the cyborg eating a really thin piece of rice. Now it's completely full! What a smart, thrifty cyborg!		2612	-	kanji Lesson_17
薬	Kanji	艹, 楽	Flowers, Comfort	radical, radical	Medicine, Drug, Drugs	Medicine, Drug, Drugs		<reading>やく</reading>	くすり			やく	くすり								<radical>Flowers</radical> can be used for <radical>comfort</radical>, but also for <kanji>medicine</kanji>. Sure, it’s a comfort to smell flowers because they smell nice, but one can also use them as medicine to heal people.	Imagine having some medicine that smells and tastes like fresh cut flowers. Smell the smell in your nose and taste the taste on your tongue.	The best way to transport all the <kanji>medicine</kanji> on land is with a <reading>yak</reading> (<ja>やく</ja>). Yaks are big, strong, and very capable of transporting flower medicine like these.	Picture a yak in your mind. Pretend you are riding atop the yak as it transports this medicine. Feel the fur of the yak in your hands as you cling on for dear life.		2613	-	kanji Lesson_17

The thing you have to check is the smell of all the rice paddies to see if they're ready for harvest. At each one, you open up your <kanji>nose</kanji> and smell deeply.	Focus in on your nose. Your nostrils get huge, and your nose is huge. Smell the rice in your imagination. Your nose is amazing.	You get to the last of the twenty rice paddies and you open up your <kanji>nose</kanji>. Something smells like <reading><ja>花</ja></reading> (<ja>はな</ja>). Oh! The <ja>花</ja> are in bloom! How lovely.	Breathe the smell of the <ja>花</ja> in deeply through your nose. How convenient that they share the same reading!		2614	-	kanji Lesson_17
側	Kanji	ｲ, 貝, 刂	Leader, Shellfish, Knife	radical, radical, radical	Side	Side		そく	<reading>がわ</reading> <reading>そば</reading>			がわ, そば	そく								The <radical>leader</radical> of the <radical>shellfish</radical> has a <radical>knife</radical> in its <kanji>side</kanji>. It's fine though, don't worry, it's just a reminder that he won the great shellfish war back when they were trying to choose the new leader.	Picture the shellfish leader in your mind and make sure to pay special attention to the knife that's sticking out of his side. It's right in the groove of his shell.	Because of this knife in his <kanji>side</kanji>, he can't pronounce certain words correctly. The most obvious one is when he says <ja>川</ja> (<ja>かわ</ja>), but it comes out of the side of his mouth as <ja><reading>がわ</reading></ja>.	Try saying <ja>かわ</ja> out the side of your mouth like the leader of the shellfish and you'll probably say <ja>がわ</ja> too. Don't stick a knife in your side though, we won't pay your medical bills when you complain to us that this mnemonic got you injured.		2615	-	kanji Lesson_17
兵	Kanji	斤, 一, ハ	Axe, Ground, Fins	radical, radical, radical	Soldier	Soldier		<reading>へい</reading> <reading>ひょう</reading>				へい, ひょう									If you set a fish on the <radical>ground</radical> and chop its <radical>fins</radical> off with an <radical>axe</radical>, you’re probably a <kanji>soldier</kanji>. Only soldiers have access to axes, and you like to eat fish, but first you have to set it on the ground to chop its fins off.	Imagine trying to carve a fish with an axe. Probably not an easy thing to do. If you’re a trained axe soldier, you’d probably have an easier time with it. Picture yourself chopping off fins as an expert axe soldier.	Uh-oh, it looks like this axe <kanji>soldier</kanji> was so excited about chopping the fins off his fish that he didn't think about how he was going to cook them. The only thing nearby to light on fire is a bale of <reading>hay</reading> (<ja>へい</ja>). Well, it's not the best thing, but at least it will get these fish cooked.	Imagine this soldier lighting a bale of hay on fire to cook his fish. The hay burns really fast, but it should be enough.		2616	-	kanji Lesson_17
堂	Kanji	<i class=radical-viking></i>, 口, 土	Viking, Mouth, Dirt	radical, radical, radical	Hall, Public Chamber	Hall, Public Chamber		<reading>どう</reading>				どう									A <radical>Viking</radical> will empty his <radical>mouth</radical> of all its <radical>dirt</radical> in the great <kanji>hall</kanji>. They all get together in some kind of <kanji>public chamber</kanji> and dish all the dirt (literal and figurative) that they've got.	Picture a long Viking hall, with a big table and tons of chairs. All of the Vikings are gossiping and sharing all their dirt on their enemies.	While the Vikings gather to spill the dirt in their <kanji>hall</kanji>, they also stuff their faces with <reading>dou</reading>ghnuts (<ja>どう</ja>). Ah yes, Vikings love to eat doughnuts when they talk trash.	Now picture all of the Vikings in the hall spitting dirt with one breath and shoveling doughnuts in with the next. It's pretty gross!		2617	-	kanji Lesson_17
塩	Kanji	土, <i class=radical-gun></i>, 口, 皿	Dirt, Gun, Mouth, Plate	radical, radical, radical, radical	Salt	Salt		えん	<reading>しお</reading>			しお	えん								There is a <radical>plate</radical> on the <radical>dirt</radical> with a <radical>gun</radical> on it. You decide to put it in your <radical>mouth</radical>, but it's very bland, so you add some <kanji>salt</kanji>. Salt will make anything tastier.	Imagine putting a gun you found on a plate on the ground in your mouth to eat it. Are you crazy? Don't eat unseasoned food. Put some salt on that first.	"As you <kanji>salt</kanji> this strange choice in food you mutter, ""<reading>She owe</reading>s (<ja>しお</ja>) me for this,"" out loud to yourself. Who is she, you ask? The lady that put this salt-less food gun down in front of you before running away."	She owes you for eating this. Next time she serves you a food sword or a food bow, she better season it properly first!		2618	-	kanji Lesson_17
席	Kanji	<i class=radical-yurt></i>, 巾	Yurt, Towel	radical, radical	Seat	Seat		<reading>せき</reading>				せき									In a <radical>yurt</radical> you use a <radical>towel</radical> as a <kanji>seat</kanji>.	Picture this yurt, with towels laid out as seats for everyone who visits.	Something about using a towel for a <kanji>seat</kanji> is very <reading>sexy</reading> (<ja>せき</ja>) to you. Probably because you associate it with sexy people using towel seats on the beach.	Imagine the sexiest person you've ever seen, using a towel as a seat next to you in this yurt. Maybe they're in a bathing suit. Maybe they're completely covered up. Either way, they're very sexy.		2619	-	kanji Lesson_17
敗	Kanji	貝, 夂	Shellfish, Winter	radical, radical	Failure, Fail	Failure, Fail		<reading>はい</reading>	やぶ			はい	やぶ								A <radical>shellfish</radical> that can't live in <radical>winter</radical> is a <kanji>failure</kanji>. Any proper shellfish would survive through the winter, but there are always a few failures every year.	Imagine you're a shellfish in the cold, cold winter. The water is freezing but you must tough it out so no one will say you're a failure in spring when they find your dead shellfish body.	The best way to avoid <kanji>failure</kanji> is to say a little <reading>hai</reading>ku (<ja>はい</ja>) to distract you from the cold. In fact, this can work in any situation where you're afraid of failure. Say a haiku aloud, it will calm your nerves and warm you from the inside.	Imagine being a shellfish freezing in the cold winter water, but you avoid failure by muttering haiku over and over to keep you warm and determined.		2620	-	kanji Lesson_17
果	Kanji	果	Fruit	radical	Fruit	Fruit		<reading>か</reading>	くだ は			か	くだ, は								The <radical>fruit</radical> radical and the <kanji>fruit</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Bodacious!		They sell <kanji>fruit</kanji> at the store, and you need to drive your <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>) to get there. A car is the fastest way to fruit.	Imagine you have a hankering for your favorite fruit. You gotta get in your car and put the pedal to the metal! Feel the wind in your hair as your car speeds down the road and listen to that engine purr.		2621	-	kanji Lesson_17
栄	Kanji	<i class=radical-viking></i>, 木	Viking, Tree	radical, radical	Prosper, Flourish	Prosper, Flourish		<reading>えい</reading>	さか			えい	さか								A <radical>Viking</radical> with enough <radical>tree</radical>s will <kanji>prosper</kanji>. Vikings need trees to build their boats and homes, and they <kanji>flourish</kanji> when they have enough.	Picture a village of Vikings, flourishing and prospering because they live right on the edge of a forest they can just hack away at whenever they need a new ship.	Vikings knew that in order to <kanji>prosper</kanji> they also needed to collect <reading>a</reading>corns (<ja>えい</ja>). If you're chopping down trees all the time, you need to actively grow them back too. That's why acorns are the actual, secret key to Viking prosperity.	Picture a bunch of kid Vikings planting acorns in rows and watching them flourish and grow into big trees that they can cut down to keep up their Viking ways.		2622	-	kanji Lesson_17

This is, in your opinion, the best way to harvest the plums – shooting at them out your window with a gun.	Imagine picking fruit off an ume tree in this way – shooting them off the branches with your gun. Picture yourself aiming at the fruits as you hear the gunshots ring in your ears and the smell of gunpowder fills the air.	You’ve probably heard of <kanji>ume</kanji> before, depending on your exposure to Japan, but an <reading>ume</reading> (<ja>うめ</ja>) is a <kanji>Japanese plum</kanji>.	Imagine eating your harvest of ume. Taste the ripe fruity flesh of these Japanese plums as you stuff your gluttonous face.		2623	-	kanji Lesson_17
無	Kanji	無	Nothing	radical	Nothing	Nothing		<reading>む</reading> <reading>ぶ</reading>	な			む, ぶ	な								The <radical>nothing</radical> radical and the <kanji>nothing</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Woah!		<kanji>Nothing</kanji> can <reading>moo</reading> (<ja>む</ja>) quite like a cow can moo. Cows are the best at going moo. That’s a fact.	Listen to this cow moo. Can you do a better moo than this moo cow? Nope.		2624	-	kanji Lesson_17
結	Kanji	糸, 吉	Thread, Good Luck	radical, radical	Bind, Tie	Bind, Tie		<reading>けつ</reading>	むす ゆ			けつ	むす, ゆ								You use a <radical>thread</radical> for <radical>good luck</radical> by <kanji>bind</kanji>ing two fingers together. You <kanji>tie</kanji> them nice and tight.	Tying two fingers together with a good luck thread is very common where you're from.	After you <kanji>bind</kanji> your fingers, the good luck starts pouring in. Literally. Suddenly <reading>ketsu</reading>p (<ja>けつ</ja>) starts pouring down from the heavens.	This ketsup is exactly what you were looking for, but now it won't stop. You need to get out of this bind by untying the thread on your finger. But it won't budge. It's covered in ketsup. Help!

Imagine all the dumb things you blabber about with your mouth open big and wide. Saying things you shouldn't say... causing drama and stuff. Shame on you.	Your big mouth <kanji>cause</kanji>s all of your friends and family to move to an <reading>inn</reading> (<ja>いん</ja>) so they don't have to live near you and hear you talk anymore. 	Who knew you could cause people to live in an inn instead of their own homes with your big mouth...		2626	-	kanji Lesson_17

It's <kanji>normal</kanji>.	Vikings get a lot of nasty stuff on their mouths from their messy eating and pillaging, so it makes sense that they'd all have mouth towels. It's as ordinary and normal as it gets, at least amongst the vikings.	It's <kanji>ordinary</kanji> for a viking to have a mouth towel, but your sloppy farmhand friend <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>) has a mouth towel too. That's a habit that's only <kanji>normal</kanji> for vikings, so why does he have one?	"When you ask Jourm about his Viking mouth towel, he just tells you, ""It's ordinary for everyone to have mouth towels. Totally normal."" Now that you think about it, he is a really messy dude, he probably needs it."		2627	-	kanji Lesson_17

""AWh yeah, that game is greatttt,"" you say in your drunken slurs. But, really, it sounds like you think all games are great, which isn't all that <kanji>discriminating</kanji> of you at all."	Picture yourself as a drunkard. What sort of discerning things are you saying? What are you trying to discern? Do you know?	So, we've figured out that your drunken utterances are not very <kanji>discerning</kanji>. But let's think about someone who is discerning. You're sitting next to a <reading>Sheikh</reading> (<ja>しき</ja>) (an Arabic leader), and boy do they sound like they know what they are talking about. Maybe it's because he's not drunk like you. He has such discerning taste, that one!	Imagine him saying some very (in your eyes) discerning things about everything around him.

非	Kanji	非	Criminal	radical	Injustice, Negative, Mistake	Injustice, Negative, Mistake		<reading>ひ</reading>				ひ									A <radical>criminal</radical> has done an <kanji>injustice</kanji> on the world or other people. Being a criminal is a <kanji>negative</kanji> thing, and even if it was just a <kanji>mistake</kanji>, it was still a crime.	Think of all the criminals you know. Even if what they did was a mistake, it was still some type of injustice, right? It was something the rest of the world sees as a negative thing.	When you commit an <kanji>injustice</kanji>, you'll know because <reading>hea</reading>t (<ja>ひ</ja>) fills your body. Maybe you've never done any kind of big thing, but when you make a <kanji>mistake</kanji> your face fills with heat and you turn red!	This is the heat of embarrassment, of knowing you did something negative or wrong.		2629	-	kanji Lesson_17

You need to <kanji>dry</kanji> Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>). He hates being wet, all of the Mongols do, so your job is to dry his entire body. And his clothes, and his horse. In fact, when it rains, you have to ride next to him keeping him dry by holding an umbrella above his head.	Imagine keeping Genghis Khan completely dry all day every day. He won't even get wet to bathe. Instead he makes you rub his body with dry sand and salts.		2630	-	kanji Lesson_17

The mighty sun is never wrong. It is absolutely correct, always.	Imagine the sun in the sky. Its rays blind you as it corrects all of the errors you’ve made.	Then, a <reading>ze</reading>ppelin (<ja>ぜ</ja>) flies in front of the sun, blocking it out. <kanji>Absolutely</kanji>, the sun cannot ignore this transgression.

Think about it – you ford a river, you ford anything that’s water, unless you’re Jesus – you’re not Jesus. You don’t walk across a tsunami, you ford it.	Imaging taking your shoes off, hiking up your pants, and holding all of your things above your head as you ford across the tsunami.	Your ability to <kanji>ford</kanji> this tsunami impresses everyone who witnesses it, especially the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>).

This tiger is from another dimension where tigers rule the earth, clad in armor with spikes. The void has allowed this tiger to cross dimensional planes.	Tigers are pretty intimidating just on their own, let alone with spikey armor. Imagine this tiger, covered in spikes. It’s roaring at you. Pretty scary, huh?	The aforementioned <kanji>void</kanji> has opened up in Little <reading>Kyo</reading>to (<ja>きょ</ja>). The spiked void tigers chose to come here in order to face off against the Hanshin Tigers baseball team in battle. It will be a vicious match here in Little Kyoto.

You were trying to <kanji>guess</kanji> by leaning over the edge of the roof, but you almost slip, and <reading>sat</reading> (<ja>さつ</ja>) down instead.	Now imagine yourself just after you sat down.
