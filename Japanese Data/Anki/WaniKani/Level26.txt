You are announcing this because you decided this is what you would <kanji>create</kanji>."	Imagine being at a maker's contest. Each person has to announce loudly what they'll create, then they have to create it.	But, a scooter has been <kanji>create</kanji>d before. What is different about yours? The scooter you will create is specifically designed to keep <reading>zo</reading>mbies (<ja>ぞう</ja>) busy. 	Imagine the scooter you created with a zombie on it.

授	Kanji	扌, 受	Fingers, Accept	radical, radical	Instruct	Instruct		<reading>じゅ</reading>	さず			じゅ	さず								There are <radical>fingers</radical> reaching towards you asking you to <radical>accept</radical> to <kanji>instruct</kanji> them. They're the fingers of students. And you're the teacher. See them reach out for knowledge. They want to accept this knowledge into their hearts and brains. Instruct them!	Picture yourself instructing a class full of knowledge hungry little kids. They reach out with their fingers to accept the truth you bring to them.	"""Yes! I will <kanji>instruct</kanji> you, my dear students!"" you cry, ""I will instruct you on how to open a small <reading>ju</reading>ice (<ja>じゅ</ja>) box!"" That's right. These little kids need help learning how to open small juice boxes (small because kids are small)."	Picture yourself instructing little kids how to punch the straw into small juice boxes. Hold it right-side-up! Don't squeeze too hard! Don't punch it through the other side! No! Don't bite the box! Instructing is hard!		4011	-	kanji Lesson_26

It's kind of a messy <kanji>mark</kanji>ing process, but it gets the job done.	Imagine breaking and bending a comb so you can use it to stamp your seal onto things.	You need this <kanji>seal</kanji> to stay at an <reading>inn</reading> (<ja>いん</ja>). All inns require official paperwork, so you had to improvise and make a seal on the fly.	Hopefully the inn accepts this seal... or you aren't going to have a place to sleep tonight. And it kind of just looks like you dipped a comb in ink and pressed it around on some paper.		4012	-	kanji Lesson_26
創	Kanji	倉, 刂	Warehouse, Knife	radical, radical	Create	Create		<reading>そう</reading>				そう									In your <radical>warehouse</radical> you use your <radical>knife</radical> to <kanji>create</kanji>. You keep old pieces of wood in your warehouse, and you use your knife to carve them into new things that only you could create.	What do you create in your warehouse? Picture all the different things you could create in your mind.	When you <kanji>create</kanji> it's good for your <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). It's so freeing, in fact, that when you get really into your creating, sometimes you'd swear your soul was floating a little bit outside of your body. But every time you notice, it sinks back down. Hmm.	When you create something your soul is happy! It's good for you, you know?		4013	-	kanji Lesson_26

You were told all black holes finish eventually, and when they do you can press a button to restore everything back to the way it was.	Imagine loitering around near (but not too near!) the black hole waiting for it to finish so you can restore the galaxy.	"Finally there's nothing else for the black hole to eat so you hit the <kanji>restore</kanji> button.... but nothing happens. ""Oh <reading>f**k</reading> (<ja>ふく</ja>) you!"" you scream as you realize you were lied to."	Maybe if you yell f**k you enough things will be restored. Ha.

You have a lot more freedom to do things after your master has departed, so until that time you just loiter about looking busy and staying out of his way.	Picture yourself loitering around your master’s fancy mansion. You’re pretending to dust things off, but you’re actually just waiting for him to depart.	"Finally, it's time for your master to <kanji>depart</kanji> and he calls to you and says, ""You are the <ja><reading>王</reading></ja> (<ja>おう</ja>) of the house now.

All of your other cars are pristine white in color, but this new car is a mix of lots of colors. It almost looks like a peacock or something it’s so colorful. Such a contrast.	Imagine this garage of yours with a sea of white cars. Now there is a new car that really sticks out like a sore thumb. Imagine yourself looking out over your cars and seeing this wacky car practically jumping out at you.	What did I say this car looks like? Oh that’s right, a pea<reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>). This car looks like a peacock. It’s the color of a peacock and you’ll look like you’re peacocking when you’re out on the town driving it. It really is such a stark <kanji>contrast</kanji> to like, every other car out there.	See yourself driving around in this peacock car. Hear the engine purr as strangers jeer and yell at you. This car sure does get a lot of attention, doesn’t it?		4016	-	kanji Lesson_26

This is no ordinary brush, mind you. It is a brush specifically designed for writing elegant characters. And it’s made from bamboo!	Imagine yourself using this bamboo writing brush. Do you know many kanji? Of course you do! Imagine yourself writing them all with this nice writing brush. It’s actually fun to write things with it!	Once the <kanji>writing brush</kanji> <reading>hits</reading> (<ja>ひつ</ja>) that paper, it’s like you transform into a totally different person. All of a sudden you’re a master calligrapher, writing anything and everything in a most beautiful fashion. Once that brush hits the paper, it’s on!	Imagine the sound the brush makes when it hits the paper. It’s a bit of a plop, and then kind of a scratching sound as the brush bristles move around. Really focus on this sound that the brush makes when it hits the paper. 		4017	-	kanji Lesson_26

This pencil lead store only accepts gold fins as payment, but your fins don’t fit in your pockets and you need your hands to carry the lead so the gold fins go in your mouth.	Imagine having these gold fins in your mouth. Taste the metal as your tongue runs over them.	You pay for your <kanji>lead</kanji> but the cashier puts it in your mouth where the gold fins were and... everything <reading>en</reading>ds (<ja>えん</ja>).	Lead poisoning, huh?

Shellfish used to be used as money way back, and these aren't shellfish you're spending, they're ones you're saving up for later.	Imagine walking down the street to deposit more shellfish into your special savings and gaze happily at the huge pile you keep far enough away that you aren't tempted to spend it.	When you want to withdraw from your <kanji>savings</kanji> you force yourself to use <reading>cho</reading>psticks (<ja>ちょ</ja>) to pick up the shellfish. They're especially slippery, hard to use chopsticks too, that way it's really hard to take too much out of your savings.	Imagine trying to lift up a shellfish with a pair of smooth chopsticks. It slips right out. Ugh! I guess that's good though, because it's a savings for a reason (you shouldn't be spending it)!		4019	-	kanji Lesson_26

""It's to blame for our circumstance!"" he yells."	In reality, this <kanji>circumstance</kanji> was actually caused by a single <ja><reading>子</reading></ja> (<ja>こ</ja>), though.

It's not like you couldn't find another way around, but it's definitely inconvenient.	"Picture this huge, tall building standing directly in the way. You peer around the other side and there is a book floating in the air that says ""Chapter 5: Success and Happiness."" Dang, you really want to get over there to that part of your life."	Someone put this building here specifically to <kanji>hinder</kanji> you. They knew you were close to the next chapter of your life, and they wanted to hinder you really good. And there they are, sitting on a throne smirking. It's the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>).	The Shougun wants to hinder you and your life. He wants you to have to work harder so you become better, faster, and stronger than anyone else.

First of all, this could be really fun. Second of all, if this person is a demon or something, you should really just obey them or they could curse you. What's the worst that could happen?!	If you <kanji>obey</kanji> the horned man you'll end up with a ton of <reading>jew</reading>els (<ja>じゅう</ja>)!	You stole those jewels together and now you're an accomplice for accompanying him!

This white tsunami is chasing after winter, and that’s why the tsunami is white—it’s a winter tsunami. It’s the most fierce and most violent kind of tsunami in existence.	Imagine this white tsunami, more violent and fierce than any other tsunami you’ve ever seen, coming toward you. It’s very frightening. Feel the cold wetness it brings to your skin.	The tsunami is too <kanji>fierce</kanji>, too <kanji>violent</kanji>, and before you realize what's happening, <reading>Gecki</reading> (<ja>げき</ja>), your beloved gecko, is lifted up and carried off into the air.

You want to know who did the <kanji>stab</kanji>bing, so you look around to see if the stabber is still in the area. But all you see is a <reading>shee</reading>p (<ja>し</ja>).

We don't want to focus too much on what the indication / sign actually is, though, because it will take away from the <kanji>indication</kanji> part (which we want to remember). So, focus on the fact that this is some kind of indication that's important, but you don't know what that indication means or is... because we'll use that with the reading.	When you spot a loitering mountain king in the winter, you know it's an <kanji>indication</kanji> that soon Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>) will appear. It's like a Groundhog's Day kind of situation, but instead it means Mrs. Chou is about to come out, perhaps early for the season.	"Imagine an announcer watching the loitering mountain king, ""There he is... and it's still winter. We all know what that means. It's a sign that Mrs. Chou will be coming out of hibernation soon.""

You sneak around the tombstone to see what this <kanji>suspicious</kanji> soul is doing, and you realize it's pretending to <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>). The soul is sitting behind the tombstone, in a small kayak, moving its arms like it's rowing through water.  Even more suspicious, the soul seems to be wearing a <reading>ke</reading>vlar (<ja>け</ja>) vest. Considering the soul is already dead, this doesn't seem like something it will need.

The guy is really big. They’re terrifying enough on their own, but put them together and you’ve got a big problem. You feel very afraid of this hole and getting stabbed. Just don’t fall in, okay?	You fall in the big hole. What did I just tell you not to do!? He’s <reading>totes</reading> (<ja>とつ</ja>) going to <kanji>stab</kanji> you for sure. Totes.

The car came out of nowhere and ran your cake right over, spraying fruit cake bits and flowers all over the place. Stupid car!	Hear the roar of the car engine as you get splattered in the face with the cake. Wipe it off of your face just in time to see the car speeding off into the distance.

There was no other path to safety, you had to cross the raging river, but you lost your footing and smashed your face on a rock and lost your lip ring.	Imagine how painful this would be, having your lip ring ripped from your lip. It would hurt a lot. Touch your lip and imagine missing half of it. Yikes.	But why were you trying to cross this <kanji>river</kanji> anyway? Well your <reading>ca</reading>r (<ja>か</ja>) was on the other side of it, and you figured if you could get to your car you could outrun the tsunami and be safe.

You probably won't succeed, but the best you can do is to shake your hands on the dirt as hard as you can. It looks like you're trying to <kanji>wave</kanji> at the ground now.	Imagine shaking your fingers at the dirt. Do you think you can shake the dirt hard enough to cause a landslide (spoilers, no).	You think you finally got the earth to <kanji>shake</kanji> but when you look down it's just your <reading>shin</reading>s (<ja>しん</ja>). Darn you shins, I thought I made some progress.
