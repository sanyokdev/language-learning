帯	Radical				Belt	Belt															This radical is the same as the kanji. It means <radical>belt</radical>.					5370	-	Lesson_35 radical
亀	Radical				Turtle	Turtle															There's a turtle shell inside this <radical>turtle</radical> radical. You can tell because there's a whole head and tail on this thing, making it a real turtle, not just a turtle shell.					5371	-	Lesson_35 radical
彑	Radical				Shuriken	Shuriken															See the <radical>shuriken</radical> stuck into the ground? In case you don't know, a shuriken is just a throwing star. Awesome ninjas use them. That's what's in this radical.					5372	-	Lesson_35 radical
為	Radical				Sake	Sake	fake														"This radical looks like a big, weird caterpillar bug thing. But, for the sake of everyone's sanity, we'll just call it <radical>sake</radical>, okay? Keep in mind, we mean sake as in ""for the sake of X,"" not as in the alcoholic beverage!"					5373	-	Lesson_35 radical
将	Radical				Commander	Commander															Who wears cleats and takes your measurements for so long that icicles start forming on your body? Your <radical>commander</radical>. The commander is very, very particular. And everyone knows the commander has to get everything exactly right. So taking your measurements takes SO long that icicles grow out of your nose. But that's okay. You have to impress your new commander, darn it!					5374	-	Lesson_35 radical
喋	Kanji	口, 世, 木	Mouth, World, Tree	radical, radical, radical	Chat, Talk	Chat, Talk		ちょう	<reading>しゃべ</reading>			しゃべ	ちょう								The <radical>mouth</radical> of the <radical>World</radical> <radical>Tree</radical>, all it does is <kanji>chat</kanji> and <kanji>talk</kanji>.	You'd think the World Tree's mouth would talk wisdom, but all it does is chat, chat, chat.	To <kanji>chat</kanji> or <kanji>talk</kanji> with the World Tree, just head over to <reading>Sha</reading>man <reading>Bay</reading> (<ja>しゃべ</ja>).	"The locals shorten Shaman Bay to ""Sha Bay,"" because they always go there to <ja>喋る</ja> with the World Tree. Imagine all the shamans hanging about in the bay."		5375	-	kanji Lesson_35

It's also a warning to the sheep that if they want to ride scooters they should also slow down, because as we all know, sheep are speed demons.	You follow the flag, but the sheep refuse to <kanji>slow</kanji> down so you have to get creative. You place <reading>chee</reading>se (<ja>ち</ja>) every ten feet or so, that way the sheep slow down to bend down on their scooters and take a bite.	Picture all of the sheep finally going slowly because there is yummy cheese all over the road.		5376	-	kanji Lesson_35
彫	Kanji	周, 彡	Circumference, Hair	radical, radical	Carve	Carve		<reading>ちょう</reading>	ほ			ちょう	ほ								There is a <radical>circumference</radical> around someone's <radical>hair</radical>, as in, you can see a circle drawn around the top of their head. As you examine it closer, and pull at it a bit, you realize that someone has <kanji>carve</kanji>d the hair off someone's head!	Their hair has literally been carved out of their head, and you discovered it. Of course, the nastiness, the smell, and the feel should be applied to your imagination to make the mnemonic stronger.	When you think of all the people who could have done this... all the people who could have <kanji>carve</kanji>d out someone's hair, only one person comes to mind, and that is Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>). She's the only person evil enough to do something like this.	You can also imagine Mrs. Chou doing the act of carving someone's hair out, but that may just be too much.		5377	-	kanji Lesson_35
測	Kanji	氵, 貝, 刂	Tsunami, Shellfish, Knife	radical, radical, radical	Measure	Measure		<reading>そく</reading>	はか			そく	はか								A <radical>tsunami</radical> will pick up a bunch of <radical>shellfish</radical> and dump them on your shore, so you take a <radical>knife</radical> and <kanji>measure</kanji> them.	You can't eat shellfish that are too small, so you place your knife along them to measure them. If they're big enough, you stick the knife in and eat them raw.	All of the shellfish you <kanji>measure</kanji> that are too small go into your <reading>sock</reading> (<ja>そく</ja>). Once the sock is full, you swing it around your head and lob it back into the ocean.	If you measure one of these shellfish and it's too small, stuff it right into your sock. Then once the sock measures about 12 shellfish long, toss it back to sea!		5378	-	kanji Lesson_35
破	Kanji	石, 皮	Stone, Skin	radical, radical	Tear	Tear		<reading>は</reading>	やぶ			は	やぶ								If you scrape a sharp <radical>stone</radical> against your <radical>skin</radical>, it will <kanji>tear</kanji>. The sharp stone tears your skin. It hurts!	Imagine this sharp stone. Feel its weight in your hand. Now drag the sharp stone against your skin. Feel your skin as it begins to tear. The pain is agonizing.	"The moment your skin <kanji>tear</kanji>s you can't help but yelp ""<reading>Ha</reading> (<ja>は</ja>)!"" It sounds like a laugh, but it's more like a pained bark."	You make this noise when you tear other things with the sharp stone too, but now it's more of a HA! TAKE THAT! Feel the same pain I feel!		5379	-	kanji Lesson_35
舎	Kanji	舎	Cottage	radical	Cottage	Cottage		<reading>しゃ</reading>				しゃ									The kanji and the radical that look like this are exactly the same. They are both <kanji>cottage</kanji>.	As long as you know the radical cottage, you know the kanji cottage.	You got this <kanji>cottage</kanji> from a <reading>sha</reading>man (<ja>しゃ</ja>). In fact, everyone you know got their cottage from a shaman. One day you're just walking in the woods, and the next thing you know, a shaman is giving you the keys to their old cottage.	I guess shamans are moving out a lot around here. Why don't you go look for a cottage you can buy from a shaman! I bet you'll get a pretty good, totally not cursed, deal!		5380	-	kanji Lesson_35
講	Kanji	言, 冓	Say, Lifeguard	radical, radical	Lecture	Lecture		<reading>こう</reading>				こう									Try to <radical>say</radical> something to a <radical>lifeguard</radical> and you'll just end up getting a <kanji>lecture</kanji>. 	A lifeguard's favorite part of the job is telling people what to do, where to swim, when to get out of the water, and they love saying it in a bunch of words.	This <kanji>lecture</kanji> loving lifeguard is none other than <ja><reading>こう</reading>いち</ja>! I mean, look how long winded the stuff on this site is? Can you imagine him trying to give you a talk about proper swimming etiquette?	"Close your eyes and picture <ja>こういち</ja> lecturing you. Ugh, it's the worst!  Hint: when you see the ""lifeguard"" radical, the reading is probably going to be <ja>こう</ja>."		5381	-	kanji Lesson_35
滞	Kanji	帯, 氵	Belt, Tsunami	radical, radical	Stagnate	Stagnate		<reading>たい</reading>	とどこお			たい	とどこお								A <radical>tsunami</radical>, once stopped by a <radical>belt</radical>, will begin to <kanji>stagnate</kanji>. This belt is a belt of water resistance, so the belt stops the tsunami. The belt has caused the tsunami to stagnate.	Watch this belt as it stagnated the tsunami. See the belt glow as its enchantment activates, immediately stagnating the tsunami water.	While you watch the tsunami <kanji>stagnate</kanji>, you get ready for work. While you were watching this whole thing happening, you were tying your <reading>tie</reading> (<ja>たい</ja>). Once the tsunami stagnated, you were all done tying your tie. And since the tsunami is no longer a threat, you’re ready to go to work.	Look in the mirror at you in your tie. Put the finishing touches on your outfit and imagine going out into the world with your tie on, no longer afraid of any tsunamis. They’re all stagnant now thanks to that magical belt.		5382	-	kanji Lesson_35
紹	Kanji	糸, 召	Thread, Call	radical, radical	Introduce	Introduce		<reading>しょう</reading>				しょう									You create a <radical>thread</radical> with someone by <radical>call</radical>ing out to them to <kanji>introduce</kanji> yourself.	You literally call out, and when they turn around, tie a thread to them, so you'll never forget that you introduced yourselves to each other.	"You want to <kanji>introduce</kanji> yourself to the <reading>Shou</reading>gun (<ja>しょう</ja>) but no matter how much you call out, he won't come close enough for you to tie your introduction thread to him. You call louder and louder, ""SHOUGUN LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF!"""	Finally the Shougun sighs and turns toward you. You call out your name and get the thread around him. Uh oh. He doesn't look happy.		5383	-	kanji Lesson_35
介	Kanji	介	Jammed In	radical	Jammed In	Jammed In		<reading>かい</reading>		すけ		かい	すけ								The <radical>jammed in</radical> radical and the <kanji>jammed in</kanji> kanji are the same!	Know your radicals, yo!	Look down! You're <kanji>jammed in</kanji>to something. You can't move your feet. What is this?! Oh, your body's been jammed in a <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>).	Picture yourself jammed into a kayak. Your pants are bunching and sticking out the sides and top. You really don't fit in here.		5384	-	kanji Lesson_35
己	Kanji	己	Oneself	radical	Oneself, Self	Oneself, Self		<reading>こ</reading> <reading>き</reading>	おのれ			こ, き	おのれ								The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <radical>oneself</radical> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <kanji>oneself</kanji> as well.	Make sure you know those radicals, yo!	<kanji>Oneself</kanji>. Who only thinks of oneself? Every <ja><reading>子</reading></ja> (<ja>こ</ja>) in the world.	Kids can only think of oneself. Until a certain age, that's literally all they can care about.		5385	-	kanji Lesson_35
厄	Kanji	厂, 巳	Cliff, Snake	radical, radical	Unlucky	Unlucky		<reading>やく</reading>				やく									If you’re on the edge of a <radical>cliff</radical> with a <radical>snake</radical>, you’re <kanji>unlucky</kanji>. You’re hanging off the edge of this cliff and you can’t pull yourself back up when you notice a snake approaching your fingers. The snake looks like it’s gonna bite you. How unlucky.	What will you do? You can either let go and fall off the cliff, or get bit by the snake if you keep holding on. Man, you’re unlucky.	Even though you’re so <kanji>unlucky</kanji>, you decide to take your chances and let go of the cliff. Amazingly, a <reading>yak</reading> (<ja>やく</ja>) runs below you and catches you as you fall. Saved by the yak!	What a nice yak this is. Perhaps your luck has turned around. Perhaps you aren’t as unlucky as you thought. Your butt sure does hurt from that fall though…		5386	-	kanji Lesson_35
亀	Kanji	亀	Turtle	radical	Turtle	Turtle		き	<reading>かめ</reading>			かめ	き								The <radical>turtle</radical> radical and the <kanji>turtle</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Nice!		You know Dragon Ball Z, right? Imagine this <kanji>turtle</kanji> doing a <reading>Kame</reading>hameha (<ja>かめ</ja>). The turtle charges up his energy and releases a mighty Kamehameha blast. Shwooom!	See this turtle as he gathers energy, shaking the earth around him, gathering chi for his Kamehameha blast. He releases it in a mighty blast of energy. Kamehameha!!		5387	-	kanji Lesson_35
互	Kanji	一, 彑	Ground, Shuriken	radical, radical	Mutual	Mutual		<reading>ご</reading>	たが			ご	たが								The <radical>ground</radical> and a <radical>shuriken</radical> have <kanji>mutual</kanji> respect for one another. The shuriken respects the ground because of how solid and stable it is, and the ground respects the shuriken for how pointy it is. They have great mutual respect here.	Pick up the shuriken and throw it into the ground. Hear it whizz through the air and then plunk into the ground. This act of aggression causes their mutual respect to waver.	Since you made the shuriken attack the ground, the <kanji>mutual</kanji> respect is out of balance. This summons <reading>Go</reading>dzilla (<ja>ご</ja>) up from the depths of the ocean once more. He always shows up when something is out of wack, to show humans the error of their ways. He picks up the shuriken and flings it into a city, which explodes, leaving a crater in the ground.	You give Godzilla a thumbs up, you see what he's trying to do. He looks down at you and nods. Now you have a mutual respect for one another too.		5388	-	kanji Lesson_35
剣	Kanji	<i class=radical-squid></i>, 刂	Squid, Knife	radical, radical	Sword	Sword		<reading>けん</reading>	つるぎ			けん	つるぎ								Tie a <radical>squid</radical> to a <radical>knife</radical> and you get a <kanji>sword</kanji>! Knives are too small to be considered a sword on their own. That's why you strapped a squid to it. They're the right shape, kinda pointed, so no one will know it's just a knife.	Imagine creating your own sword out of a knife and a squid.	You learned how to make <kanji>sword</kanji>s this way from <reading>Ken</reading> (<ja>けん</ja>) the samurai. He put his own little squid buddy on his knife and now no one realizes it's not a sword!	Picture Ken swinging his squid sword at you. *Squish* it squirts ink on your shoulder.

Only in spring can you measure your lifespan, just as easily as you measure your height and weight.	On the first day of spring, all the girls and boys line up to measure their lifespans.	If your <kanji>lifespan</kanji> measurement isn't as long as you'd like, you need to drink more small <reading>ju</reading>ice (<ja>じゅ</ja>) boxes this year. They're good for your health, after all!	Look at Salmon, over here. She drank a thousand small juice boxes last year and now her measurement says she's gonna live another hundred years!		5390	-	kanji Lesson_35

He is my boyfriend and he is very protective of me. So don’t loiter around my skin for too long or he will beat you up.	He is a jealous guy. He will beat you down if you loiter around my skin for too long. Imagine he is beating you up right now. He is screaming at you as he does so.	 <kanji>He</kanji> says the only way he will stop beating you up is if you give him some <reading>curry</reading> (<ja>かれ</ja>). You give him some curry.	He accepts the curry you give him. Smell the curry smell as he eats it right in front of you. He is eating very loudly.		5391	-	kanji Lesson_35
恥	Kanji	耳, 心	Ear, Heart	radical, radical	Shame	Shame		ち	<reading>は</reading> <reading>はじ</reading>			は, はじ	ち								Your <radical>ear</radical> listens to your <radical>heart</radical> and feels <kanji>shame</kanji>. Your heart is full of shame for how you’ve lived your life and when your ear hears all the things you’ve done, your ear feels shame too.	Feel the shame. Feel the shame in both your ear and your heart. Imagine the things you’ve done to make you feel so much shame.	You must cleanse your spirit of this <kanji>shame</kanji>. You decide to complete <reading>Haj</reading> (<ja>はじ</ja>). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja). Upon arrival in Mecca, you think of a funny joke and bust out laughing. “<reading>HA</reading>HAHAHAHAHA!! (<ja>は</ja>) HAHAHAHAHA!!!” Oh man, you’re in a temple and that was completely inappropriate. You feel even more shame than before.	You’re super embarrassed for bringing so much shame on yourself again. But then you think of another joke. “Hahaha!” Better luck with the next Haj, I guess.		5392	-	kanji Lesson_35
杉	Kanji	木, 彡	Tree, Hair	radical, radical	Cedar	Cedar			<reading>すぎ</reading>			すぎ									There’s a <radical>tree</radical> in your <radical>hair</radical>, I think it’s a <kanji>cedar</kanji>. How did that cedar tree get in your hair?  (Certain types of cedar trees have bark that comes off in fine threads, making them very hairy trees. So this kanji makes perfect sense!)	Imagine having a cedar tree in your hair. It’s just a little tree, a sapling, but it’s pretty strange and awkward. It does smell nice though. Mmm… cedar.	Once the <kanji>cedar</kanji> is fully grown, you use the cedar wood to make a guitar for Sue. A <reading>Sue gui</reading>tar (<ja>すぎ</ja>), if you will. This Sue guitar was made just for Sue. She’ll love it.	Give Sue her Sue guitar. Hear Sue squeal with glee as she receives her Sue guitar.		5393	-	kanji Lesson_35

Hey tsunami, I was eating that soup!	Picture a bowl of soup, but now there is a cross and some tsunami water in it.	You pull the cross out of your <kanji>soup</kanji> and see that the cross' <reading>jew</reading>els (<ja>じゅう</ja>) fell off and are in there now. The jewels sparkle, shine, and dissolve into the soup!	You're curious so you take a sip of this jewel soup and... it's delicious! You should make more and sell it!		5394	-	kanji Lesson_35
噌	Kanji	口, 曽	Mouth, Mask	radical, radical	Boisterous	Boisterous		<reading>そ</reading>				そ									Your <radical>mouth</radical> is wearing a <radical>mask</radical> so people won't realize you're the one being so <kanji>boisterous</kanji>. You want to be loud and rowdy, but you don't want anyone to know it's you. If you cover your mouth with this mask, people won't know you're the one being so boisterous.	Go put a mask on right now, cover everything around your mouth so it's hard to tell who you are. Now go outside and be as boisterous as possible!	"You're being anonymously <kanji>boisterous</kanji> outside when suddenly someone shoves <reading>so</reading>ap (<ja>そ</ja>) in your mouth! ""I don't know who you are, but you're much too boisterous! Wash your mouth out with that soap!"" they yell."	Using your boisterous mouth, taste the disgusting soapy soap.

The <kanji>flame</kanji>s gets bigger, surround you, and then everything <reading>en</reading>ds (<ja>えん</ja>).	Sorry, but standing in a blaze isn't the best idea.

"For goodness sake! Please remember this isn't ""sake"" as in <ja>お酒</ja>! It's the English ""sake,"" that rhymes with ""bake,"" ""cake,"" and ""steak."" Oops.. now I'm hungry."	For the <kanji>sake</kanji> of convenience, companies will use <reading>ea</reading>gles (<ja>い</ja>) for delivery jobs in the future.

I bet you didn't know this, but a bear can boil whenever it wants. Imagine a bear heating itself up and boiling, its fur and skin bubbling and letting off steam.	A <kanji>bear</kanji> boiling in front of you should fill you with great honor. Or, as they say in Latin: Magma <reading>cum</reading> (<ja>くま</ja>) laude.  Get it? A little hot bear humor for you.

What is the name of your animal? Your animal is named <reading>Goku</reading> (<ja>ごく</ja>). Yeah, like Goku from Dragon Ball Z. You don’t want your little Goku to go to <kanji>prison</kanji>, so you say that he’s a dog.

See the cross start to blur in front of you from how drunk you are.	If you drink so much that you become <kanji>drunk</kanji>, then your alcohol will begin to taste like water. What is the reading of <ja>水</ja>? It's <ja><reading>すい</reading></ja>, which is the reading for this kanji.	Speaking of <ja>水</ja>, you need to drink some.

You are demonstrating this practice in front of an audience. You want them to take you seriously so you wear a <reading>su</reading>it (<ja>す</ja>). A very nice suit.

Unfortunately, he can't just tell people he likes drinking glasses of soy sauce, or they'll look at him weird. Instead he orders it as a commander's alcohol too.
