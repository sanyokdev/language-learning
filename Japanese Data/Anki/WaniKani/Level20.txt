飛	Radical				Fly	Fly															This radical is pretty complicated, but not much looks like this radical, so you're in luck. This looks like a giant flying fortress of some kind. See the propellers on the back as it moves to the left? Just imagine something like this flying through the air. That's why this radical is <radical>fly</radical>, because it is flying.					3096	-	Lesson_20 radical
兼	Radical				Mona Lisa	Mona Lisa															This radical looks like a combination of the brush radical and the beauty kanji (<ja>美</ja>). So what's something beautiful you can paint with a brush? The most famous is probably the <radical>Mona Lisa</radical>.					3097	-	Lesson_20 radical
巛	Radical				Flood	Flood, Arrows															The three lines that make up the river radical are being pulled to one direction. It's a giant force of water going to the left. It's a <radical>flood</radical>! RUN!					3098	-	Lesson_20 radical
至	Radical				Mole	Mole, Boob Grave															There's trash on some dirt that seems to be... moving? If you lift up that trash you'll find a <radical>mole</radical> in the dirt! Moles like to dig around underground and look for stuff to grab (like trash). They're the raccoons of the ground.					3099	-	Lesson_20 radical
義	Radical				Righteousness	Righteousness															The horns of the king. They are so large and they cause the king to have an ego. This ego gives the king a sense of <radical>righteousness</radical> that he shouldn't have. Well, I suppose that's what kings do, but those horns are ridiculous.					3100	-	Lesson_20 radical
<i class=radical-explosion></i>	Radical				Explosion	Explosion															See the energy bursting outward? That's an <radical>explosion</radical>. Boom!					3101	-	Lesson_20 radical
困	Kanji	口, 木	Mouth, Tree	radical, radical	Distressed, Troubled	Distressed, Troubled		<reading>こん</reading>	こま			こん	こま								If you put your <radical>mouth</radical> on a <radical>tree</radical> and try to eat it, you’re probably a <kanji>distressed</kanji> and <kanji>troubled</kanji> individual (unless you’re a woodchuck). You don’t need to eat this tree, you have plenty of food at home. Get your mouth off that tree you distressed child.	Imagine yourself as this distressed and troubled person. Taste the taste of sap and bark in your mouth as you nom on the tree with all your might.	You thought you were the most <kanji>distressed</kanji> and <kanji>troubled</kanji> person in this situation, but then you look up and see a very equally distressed and troubled <reading>con</reading>dor (<ja>こん</ja>). The tree you've been mouthing is its home. And now you've slobbered all over it, ruining this condor's day.	Picture a very distressed condor watching you munch your mouth all over its tree house. You've made a condor enemy this day.		3102	-	kanji Lesson_20
災	Kanji	巛, 火	Flood, Fire	radical, radical	Disaster	Disaster		<reading>さい</reading>	わざわ			さい	わざわ								A <radical>flood</radical> and a <radical>fire</radical>! At the same time? This is a <kanji>disaster</kanji>!	Imagine a disaster so bad that there are floods AND fires. That's too much!	This <kanji>disaster</kanji> was caused by your <reading>cy</reading>borg (<ja>さい</ja>)! It's malfunctioning, running around leaking large amounts of water and breathing fire. I guess you didn't work out all the kinks before you let it roam wild.	You better figure out a way to stop your cyborg from causing more disasters like this. Fix it now, or you're gonna be in big trouble.		3103	-	kanji Lesson_20
機	Kanji	木, 幺, 戈, 人	Tree, Poop, Drunkard, Person	radical, radical, radical, radical	Machine	Machine		<reading>き</reading>	はた			き	はた								A <radical>drunkard</radical> is the kind of <radical>person</radical> who would <radical>poop</radical> two times under a <radical>tree</radical> before using a <kanji>machine</kanji> toilet. There’s a perfectly good outhouse with a machine toilet right there, but this drunkard is so drunk that he decides to poop under the tree instead. And not only does he poop once, he poops twice.	Imagine this drunkard, squatting down under the tree to poop. You can smell the poop and a faint stench of alcohol in the air. How could he not have realized that there was a portable machine toilet right there?	Oh, I see – the door to the outhouse with the machine toilet is locked, and the drunkard doesn’t have the <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>). If he had a <kanji>machine</kanji> like a jackhammer, or a circular saw, or some other heavy duty machine, he might be able to get in without a key, but since he has none of those or a key, he’s reduced to pooping under the tree instead.	Listen to the drunkard grumbling about the lack of a key as he poops under the tree. He doesn’t sound happy, and every time he stresses to push out the poop, his voice fluctuates. Imagine hearing this in your mind and being a wee bit disgusted.		3104	-	kanji Lesson_20
率	Kanji	亠, 幺, <i class=radical-explosion></i>, 十	Lid, Poop, Explosion, Cross	radical, radical, radical, radical	Percent, Percentage	Percent, Percentage		<reading>りつ</reading> <reading>そつ</reading>	ひき			りつ, そつ	ひき								Sitting on the <radical>lid</radical> of a toilet, an <radical>explosion</radical> of <radical>poop</radical> erupts out, getting feces on your <radical>cross</radical> necklace and a large <kanji>percent</kanji> of your clothing. You were just trying to chill out, sitting on the lid of the toilet, and an explosion of poop just flew out the toilet bowl. Now you have poop all over you, like ninety-nine percent of your body is covered in poop. Even your cross necklace.	This feels disgusting. Imagine yourself being covered in poop. Feel the warm smelly sludge covering your body as the abysmal aroma wafts up into your nostrils. You’re nearly one hundred percent covered in poop.	You’re emotionally scarred, so you need to eat your comfort food in order to calm yourself down. Your comfort food is <reading>Ritz</reading> (<ja>りつ</ja>) crackers, so you clean one hundred <kanji>percent</kanji> of the poop off you so your body is now zero percent covered by poop, and you start to devour a box of Ritz crackers.	Now that the percent of your body covered in poop has reached zero, you can comfortably eat. Imagine yourself eating these Ritz crackers as you slowly start to feel better about life. Taste their buttery crispness as they crumble in your mouth.		3105	-	kanji Lesson_20
飛	Kanji	飛	Fly	radical	Fly	Fly		<reading>ひ</reading>	と			ひ	と								The <radical>fly</radical> radical and the <kanji>fly</kanji> kanji are exactly the same! Awesome!		When you <kanji>fly</kanji>, you generate a lot of <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>) because you’re moving so fast through the atmosphere. Normally this heat would be a nuisance, but you’re a superhero so it doesn’t bother you. This is actually the reason you’re able to fly – you’re a superhero and super resistant to heat.	You’re flying through the air super fast. Feel the air rushing past you as heat builds up all over your body from rocketing through the air so fast.		3106	-	kanji Lesson_20
害	Kanji	宀, 生, 口	Roof, Life, Mouth	radical, radical, radical	Damage, Injury, Harm	Damage, Injury, Harm		<reading>がい</reading>				がい									You slip off the <radical>roof</radical>, your <radical>life</radical> flashes before your eyes, and you smash your <radical>mouth</radical> on the ground causing some serious <kanji>damage</kanji>. Oof, this is a really bad <kanji>injury</kanji>, you fell all the way off the roof and onto your mouth.	Imagine that moment as you fall off the roof. In slow motion you can see the roof moving away, you see yourself as a little kid, a teen, an adult, then BAM you've injured your mouth. Ow ow ow!	"As you try to assess the <kanji>damage</kanji>, you hear someone shout, ""<reading>Guy</reading> (<ja>がい</ja>), hey, you okay, guy?"" They run up to you, but your mouth is too <kanji>damage</kanji>d, you can't respond. ""Okay guy, I'm gonna call you Guy now. Let's get you to the hospital."""	No matter how much you try to wave your hands and gesture, they keep calling you Guy. It's really annoying, actually, because you aren't a guy and you aren't Guy either. But your mouth is too damaged for you to tell him.		3107	-	kanji Lesson_20
余	Kanji	<i class=radical-hat></i>, 示	Hat, Jackhammer	radical, radical	Surplus, Excess	Surplus, Excess		<reading>よ</reading>	あま			よ	あま								Regardless of whether or not you wear a <radical>hat</radical> while you <radical>jackhammer</radical>, you’re going to have a <kanji>surplus</kanji> of noise. Jackhammers are loud, and your hat is doing nothing to dampen the racket. There’s a surplus of commotion coming from the jackhammer and onlookers are not amused.	The hat you’re wearing is ridiculous, giving you a surplus of bad style. Imagine a bunch of people scowling at you, not only because of your crazy hat, but because of the annoying sound of the jackhammer. Hear the obnoxious noise around you as the jackhammer rattles your bones.	One of the people walking by is the owner of a push cart <reading>yo</reading>-yo (<ja>よ</ja>) stand. Having a <kanji>surplus</kanji> of yo-yos, he starts throwing them at you. This makes you stop using the jackhammer as you need both hands to fend off the yo-yo barrage.	Your hat is doing little to defend you from the onslaught of yo-yos being tossed at you. Feel the yo-yos hitting your body and listen to them roll away after striking you.		3108	-	kanji Lesson_20
難	Kanji	<i class=radical-chinese></i>, 隹	Chinese, Turkey	radical, radical	Difficult	Difficult		<reading>なん</reading>	むずか			なん	むずか								A <radical>Chinese</radical> <radical>turkey</radical> is <kanji>difficult</kanji> to find because they are so rare. Chinese turkeys are the rarest variety of turkey, so naturally, finding one is exceedingly difficult.	Try and picture a Chinese turkey in your brain. Now imagine yourself trying to catch it, but you just can’t. It’s too difficult. The Chinese turkey is too elusive.	Do you know the actual reason Chinese turkeys are so <kanji>difficult</kanji> to find? Do you know how many Chinese turkeys there are in the world? <reading>None</reading> (<ja>なん</ja>). They don’t exist. How many Chinese turkeys are there? None.	So this is why you had such a difficult time finding and catching one – there were none to be caught. Imagine the sadness you felt when you realized that there were no Chinese turkeys to catch and that none exist in this world.		3109	-	kanji Lesson_20
妨	Kanji	女, 方	Woman, Direction	radical, radical	Obstruct, Impede	Obstruct, Impede		<reading>ぼう</reading>	さまた			ぼう	さまた								A <radical>woman</radical> with <radical>direction</radical> will have things <kanji>obstruct</kanji> her path. It's a sad fact that it's still a man's world out there!	Picture this woman with direction, knocking down obstruction after obstruction on her path to success. 	This woman is truly magnificent. Some compare her to a <reading>bow</reading>ling (<ja>ぼう</ja>) ball, because of how she knocks down the obstructions in her path like bowling pins.	Now imagine that she actually is a bowling ball. Watch her roll down the bowling lane and smash all those stupid pins!		3110	-	kanji Lesson_20
被	Kanji	ネ, 皮	Spirit, Skin	radical, radical	Incur	Incur		<reading>ひ</reading>	かぶ			ひ	かぶ								A <radical>spirit</radical> loses its <radical>skin</radical> as a part of the damages it <kanji>incur</kanji>s after death.	Some spirits get mad when they lose their skin, and this makes them incur their wrath on the living humans that still have skin.	When you <kanji>incur</kanji> the wrath of an angry spirit, you'll feel your skin <reading>hea</reading>t (<ja>ひ</ja>) up.	It feels like your skin is cooking! You're turning red. The spirit is trying to incur the same type of skin damage it had done to it by super-heating your skin! Oww owww!		3111	-	kanji Lesson_20
裕	Kanji	ネ, 谷	Spirit, Valley	radical, radical	Abundant, Plentiful	Abundant, Plentiful		<reading>ゆう</reading>				ゆう									In <radical>spirit</radical> <radical>valley</radical>, spirits are <kanji>abundant</kanji>. Hence the name. Spirit valley has over two billion spirits floating in it.	Just picture those forest spirits from that famous anime film. The woods are full of them. An abundant valley of spirits.	In spirit valley, it's not just spirits that are <kanji>abundant</kanji>. There is an abundance of <reading>you</reading>ths (<ja>ゆう</ja>) as well. 	Imagine an abundant number of spirits and youths hanging out, drinking microbrews and eating avocado toast. Spirit Valley is a weird place.		3112	-	kanji Lesson_20

The earth doesn't just slide, it <kanji>shake</kanji>s and <kanji>quake</kanji>s.	Picture this happening in real time. First it starts to rain really hard, then the ground starts to shift and run, then everything is shaking and quaking so violently it's an earthquake!	The <kanji>earthquake</kanji> shakes you so violently that you fall over, banging your <reading>shin</reading> (<ja>しん</ja>) on the coffee table. The edge of the coffee table is very sharp, so it cuts into your shin pretty badly.	You grab your shin, but the earthquake shakes the coffee table toward you to hit your shin yet again!

With these nine flags you take them one by one and put them up your <kanji>butt</kanji>.	Imagine taking these nine flags... count 'em... and putting them up your butt. With each one that's up there it gets harder and harder to fit the next one in.	"Now that you have nine flags inside your <kanji>butt</kanji>, you have to get them out. But, you don't know how to. So you ask <reading>Siri</reading> (<ja>しり</ja>), ""how do I get nine flags out of my butt?"""

Someone stuck a flag into some sort of animal, pushing it under the ground. All that’s visible now is some fur and part of the tail.	What kind of animal could it be? You start to feel the soft fur with your hand and then the stench of death hits your nostrils. Ew.	You try to pull the flag out of the ground and hear a rumbling buzzing sound. At the end of the flagpole you see a huge <reading>bee</reading>hive (<ja>び</ja>)! These bees made their home under the <kanji>tail</kanji>! Maybe that’s why the flag was sticking in it… to warn people. Oops.	See the bees swarming out from around the tail and toward your face. Run!

"You want to know what these <kanji>contraptions</kanji> are for, so you ask. The drunkard says, ""These are <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>) contraptions *urp* they're for your uh *blarp* kayak... things."""	"""Kayak contraptions"" is pretty vague, but you do have a kayak, so you're tempted anyway.

It is <kanji>certain</kanji> that you will damage it.	Try hitting a sponge on a turkey's forehead. Not certain. Now a stone. <kanji>Certain</kanji>.	You're killing this turkey, and you need to make sure he's dead for <kanji>certain</kanji>. The reason you need to make sure this turkey is dead is because of the <reading>cock</reading> (<ja>かく</ja>) in your life. Male chickens get really jealous when turkeys are around.

"The dirt being crushed under this <kanji>pressure</kanji> can't help but react by sneezing out, ""<reading>Achoo</reading> (<ja>あつ</ja>)!""
