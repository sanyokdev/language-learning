忌	Kanji	己, 心	Oneself, Heart	radical, radical	Mourning	Mourning		<reading>き</reading>	い			き	い								If you only let <radical>oneself</radical> (yourself) into your <radical>heart</radical>, you'll end up <kanji>mourning</kanji> all of the loves and friendships you could have had but didn't let in.	Picture yourself all alone. You never let anyone into your heart but yourself, and now you're mourning the life and friends you could have had.	While you're in <kanji>mourning</kanji>, you feel a sharp pain in your crying eyes. A <reading>key</reading> (<ja>き</ja>) comes sliding out with your tears. You look around wildly, but you're still alone. Is this... the key of mourning?	You try to push the key back into your body. Back into your eye, you even try to swallow it, but it comes back out. Finally you look down at your mourning heart and try the key there. It clicks. And opens.		8680	-	kanji Lesson_59

It's an upward transition, so that's nice, but it's still going to take you a long time to get used to using a big helicopter instead of a scooter.	You decide one <kanji>transition</kanji> isn't enough, so you transition to a <reading>cen</reading>taur (<ja>せん</ja>) too. Now you're a big half horse-half human creature and you'll fit in the big helicopter better.	A centaur is just a human halfway between transitioning into a horse, so it isn't even that hard to do!		8681	-	kanji Lesson_59
拙	Kanji	扌, 出	Fingers, Exit	radical, radical	Clumsy, Unskillful	Clumsy, Unskillful		<reading>せつ</reading>	つたな			せつ	つたな								You have to use your <radical>fingers</radical> to make an <radical>exit</radical> because you're so <kanji>clumsy</kanji>. You can't seem to get the door to open, your hands just slip around on the nob uselessly. Instead, you take your fingers and stick them into the door frame, pulling the whole thing off the hinges so you can leave.	Of course, you're too clumsy to do that right either, you accidentally threw the door backwards and hurt some people...	After you make your <kanji>clumsy</kanji> mistake you realize that these doors come in <reading>sets</reading> (<ja>せつ</ja>). And now you have to try to open another door. And another door. So many sets of doors!	Imagine trying to use your clumsy fingers all over the sets of doors. You keep falling over and hurting yourself. Why is it so hard to leave?!		8682	-	kanji Lesson_59
峠	Kanji	山, 上, 下	Mountain, Above, Below	radical, radical, radical	Peak	Peak, Ridge			<reading>とうげ</reading>			とうげ									If you're on a <radical>mountain</radical> looking from <radical>above</radical> to <radical>below</radical> that means you're on the <kanji>peak</kanji> of the mountain.	Imagine standing right at the peak of a mountain looking at down from above and everything down below. You're really, really high up!	It's only on this type of mountain <kanji>peak</kanji> that you'll be able to find the rare and adorable <reading>To</reading>kyo <reading>ge</reading>cko (<ja>とうげ</ja>). These tiny little critters can only be found on the ridges going above and below the mountains in Tokyo. There are like six mountains in Tokyo, so the next time you're scaling the ridges keep your eyes open for the Tokyo gecko!	Picture yourself sitting on a mountain peak in Tokyo and watching a little Tokyo gecko run up and down on them. It's adorable and totally worth the climb.		8683	-	kanji Lesson_59
篤	Kanji	竹, 馬	Bamboo, Horse	radical, radical	Deliberate	Deliberate		<reading>とく</reading>	あつ			とく	あつ								If someone makes a <radical>bamboo</radical> <radical>horse</radical>, you know it's <kanji>deliberate</kanji>. You can't accidentally make an entire horse out of bamboo.	Someone sat down and deliberately planned the entire horse out, collected the materials, and made it by hand.	"As you admire all the <kanji>deliberate</kanji> details in this bamboo horse, the ghost of <reading>Toku</reading>gawa (<ja>とく</ja>) Ieyasu appears before you! ""I deliberately made this horse to show you how important being deliberate is. You should be absolutely certain and decisive about your decisions."""	Tokugawa Ieyasu then poofs out of existence and so does the bamboo horse.		8684	-	kanji Lesson_59
叔	Kanji	上, 小, 又	Above, Small, Stool	radical, radical, radical	Uncle, Aunt	Uncle, Aunt		しゅく		<reading>お</reading>		お	しゅく								There were lots of things that were <radical>above</radical> you when you were <radical>small</radical> that you would need a <radical>stool</radical> to reach, so you just asked your <kanji>aunt</kanji> or <kanji>uncle</kanji> to get them for you.	Your parents didn't want you having those things, which is why they put them up high, but your aunt and uncle would always spoil you and get them for you.	You ask your <kanji>aunt</kanji> and <kanji>uncle</kanji> to help you reach your special <reading>o</reading>bi (<ja>お</ja>) from high up in the closet. 	You aren't supposed to wear your obi unless it's a special occasion, but your aunt and uncle don't know that. Now you can run around with it on your head and your parents can't stop you by putting it up high!		8685	-	kanji Lesson_59

A male turkey will peck the spoon out of your hand and run away. But a female turkey will wonder why you're putting a spoon there, stop, and look up at you wondering if you're okay.	Picture the female turkey stopping when it sees you holding out a spoon. Why are you doing that human? it thinks. Are you sick?	The <kanji>female</kanji> turkey then runs around making a <reading>mess</reading> (<ja>めす</ja>) of things trying to figure out what's wrong with you. She kicks around her hay, water bowl, and scratches at your pants, making more mess marks on them. But you don't move and she gets even more worried.	Imagine watching a female turkey make a mess of her own cage because she thinks you need help. How sweet.		8686	-	kanji Lesson_59

Imagine a little crab getting stuck in a crab trap with dirt and other crabs. Endure the horror as long as you can, little friend.	You decide to make the little crab that <kanji>endure</kanji>d being stuck in a dirty crab trap your pet, and put a <reading>colla</reading>r (<ja>こら</ja>) round its little neck.	Imagine yourself putting a collar around the crab's neck, then adding a leash and taking your crab for a walk around your neighborhood.		8687	-	kanji Lesson_59

Go, perform please. What do you mean you didn't know the recital was right now? Well, tough luck. Recite!	The recital is happening now. So open your mouth and start already!	Here, if you are too afraid to start the <kanji>recital</kanji> now drink this <reading>gin</reading> (<ja>ぎん</ja>) to get your courage up. But once you're done drinking it the recital starts!

So hard that I couldn't come up with one. But it's very possible that one of you will!	How hard is it to come up with a good mnemonic for a crab trap? Very hard!	You know what else is <kanji>very</kanji> something? <reading>Jean</reading>s (<ja>じん</ja>). Jeans are very expensive. Jeans are very tight. Jeans are very popular. Jeans are very a lot of things.	How many sentences can you make with very and jeans? More than me I hope.		8689	-	kanji Lesson_59

The noise from their jackhammering echos up through the mountain and up toward the sky where the gods live. As long as each person uses their own jackhammer, the sound will be loud enough to reach them.	Man your own jackhammer! (And worship the gods.)	Unfortunately, the people who live around here can also hear you and the others <kanji>worship</kanji> in the mountain and they're going to <reading>sue</reading> (<ja>すう</ja>) you for the noise. 	You try to argue that you can't sue someone for the way they choose to worship, but they say they're all deaf now, all the animals have gone, and no one sleeps anymore because of the shaking. Yikes, they might have a case!		8690	-	kanji Lesson_59

You take it off and see that it's shiny and hard and protected.	Picture your hat and all of the other things the tsunami + tree water touched. It's all been hardened with a thick coating of the lacquer.	You decide to scoop up the rest of the <kanji>lacquer</kanji> water and use it on your furniture to protect it from your <reading>shih tzu</reading> (<ja>しつ</ja>). Now it can't bite or scratch or ruin any of your things anymore!	Watch as your shih tzu tries to bite your now lacquered chair. It gets its teeth around the leg, but it's hard as a rock.

It's a <kanji>cape</kanji>! No, not the kind you wear, the geographical kind. When you're on land, most capes look like turtle shell mountains sticking out into the sea. Do you know any capes like that near where you live?	Picture the turtle shell shaped cape. Feel the salty wind in your hair!	You decide to walk along this <kanji>cape</kanji> because it looks like the perfect place to get rid of your old <reading>me</reading>at <reading>sack</reading> (<ja>みさき</ja>). It's starting to smell, but the ocean breeze from the cape pulls the meat sack out of your hands and off into the sky (then probably into the sea too).	The next time you go to the cape, remember to bring your old, used meat sack. You can toss it right into the ocean and it won't bother you ever again!

It may seem like there are a bunch of turkeys under there, but it's just the shape the reef takes. Though I guess if you're looking from above the water it really does look like a bunch of turkeys freaking out.	The <kanji>reef</kanji> is the <reading>Shou</reading>gun's (<ja>しょう</ja>) favorite place to be nowadays. He sits next to the water, and stares down into it for hours.	You don't know if the Shougun likes the reef because he likes the beauty of the ocean, or if he's fantasizing about turkeys boiling. He's a... complex man.		8694	-	kanji Lesson_59

Know your radicals, yo!	<kanji>Barracks</kanji> are pretty big, so they weigh a <reading>ton</reading> (<ja>とん</ja>). And they probably take tons of materials to build.

You <kanji>marry</kanji> this woman right away and you both go straight to an <reading>inn</reading> (<ja>いん</ja>) together!

Right now you're using your fingers as finger puppets, imitating one of your friends to the others.	"Picture your angry friend standing up next to your fingers, shouting, ""I'm the real me! That's just an imitation!"" The rest of your friends look nervously at each other. They doubt this person is real now."	Everyone thinks the friend you were trying to <kanji>imitate</kanji> is the imitation now and they have them in a <reading>gui</reading>llotine (<ja>ぎ</ja>). You even doubt if they're an imitation or if your fingers are the imitation.	Okay, so that's a lie, Your fingers are definitely imitating them, but you don't want to end up in the guillotine so you keep your mouth shut.		8697	-	kanji Lesson_59

You only let people who are really, really close to you look at your womb. So if this guy is acting that friendly he should have introduced himself first.	Imagine having someone you aren't friendly with trying to have a look at your womb. No thank you.	"This <kanji>friendly</kanji> guy comes up to you and start to introduce himself, ""<ja><reading>ぼく</reading></ja>-"" but you stop him. He's been getting way too friendly with your womb and you don't want to hear who he is. He can <ja>ぼく</ja> at someone else, you're out."

You walk up to the gate tree and curl up under its branches. No one will bother you because the tree is blocking the gate from being used.	Imagine spending your leisure time curled up under a tree that's growing through a gate. It's so cozy and secluded!	"As you <kanji>leisure</kanji>ly nap, you hear a gruff voice, ""Ah, you're done too, huh?"" It's Genghis <reading>Khan</reading> (<ja>かん</ja>)!

Music isn't really real unless people hear it outside of those secret underground concerts.	Think of all that music you listened to underground but not in the light of the sun. None of that was official music. None of it!	Once the music is <kanji>official</kanji>, you'll feel it in your <reading>sou</reading>l (<ja>そう</ja>). When you listen to it outside, under the bright sun, your soul gets to finally hear it too.

He said to lower yourself and this is the only way you can interpret that.	Imagine dropping down in a rice paddy, then again in front of your cross. Be as lowly as you can make yourself.	The only problem about being <kanji>lowly</kanji> is the <reading>he</reading>at (<ja>ひ</ja>). Everyone always told you that heat rises, but not here. The rice paddy is incredibly hot... unless oh no. Is that the heat of hell?

Imagine yourself as a leader who's come to despise every single one of their followers. Look down at them in disgust as they ask you to grant them all a pony.	The more you <kanji>despise</kanji> them, the more <reading>boo</reading>ze (<ja>ぶ</ja>) you drink. This is not smart or healthy, but it's what this kind of hate does to people.	This is not a healthy way to handle things! If you despise someone you should talk to them, don't turn to booze. Don't be like every leader that's come before you.		8703	-	kanji Lesson_59
