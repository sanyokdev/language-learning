Once the shellfish has a taste for being a <kanji>robber</kanji>, he'll join a Boso<reading>zoku</reading> (<ja>ぞく</ja>) bike gang so he can keep stealing more and more crosses. He'll drink more, steal more, and get to ride cool motorcycles.	Picture a robber shellfish in a Bosozoku bike gang.

But, the moon wasn't the moon, it was your big, pale, round tummy. You just cut it open, and now you can see your <kanji>intestines</kanji>.	Imagine the moon, then imagine it cross-fading into your big, round tummy. Then, cut it open because you think the moon is easy to cut. And finally, see your intestines as clearly as you can.	All over the world, people are cutting their bellies open, because they think its an easy moon (versus a normal moon, or hard moon, presumably). This is because they have fallen victim to a spell by Mrs. <reading>Chou</reading> (<ja>ちょう</ja>).	This scene was in all the omen radicals you've been seeing about her. If only you could have stopped her, then none of this would have happened, right? Perhaps it was all destiny, you think, as your intestines fall from your stomach and Mrs. Chou cackles over your weakening body.		8444	-	kanji Lesson_57

The music made the tree vibrate at juuust the right frequency that it, combined with the hot sun, made the tree turn into a puddle. You can't just leave it being all blobby on the ground, so you find a tank for it.	Imagine scooping a melted tree into a tank. It's a very strange sensation.

"Imagine felling trees with a bunch of other guys, yelling things like, ""This is what you get for stepping on my turf!"" It's a little silly."	As you <kanji>attack</kanji> the innocent trees with your chains and sticks, a bunch of <reading>bats</reading> (<ja>ばつ</ja>) come flying out and attack YOU!

Two tatami mats, that is. This is a pretty common measurement in Japan, so you should get really familiar with the amount of space that two tatami mats take up together.	Picture how big a two mat area is. Lay down and feel the peace this much space brings to you.	A <kanji>two mat area</kanji> also happens to be big enough to hold <reading>two bo</reading>dies (<ja>つぼ</ja>). That's enough space to bring peace to two living, or dead, bodies!

That's the sweetest color in existence, everyone knows that. After all, blue raspberry flavor is dark blue and it's super sweet.	Turn your thread a sweet navy color and people will be reminded of yummy blue raspberry. MmMmm.	Now that your threads are <kanji>navy</kanji> colored you need to be careful that <reading>con</reading>dors (<ja>こん</ja>) don't try to steal it for their nests.

You <kanji>spread out</kanji> your net and <kanji>arrange</kanji> it just so. You expect it to catch a turkey, but instead you catch the ancient Egyptian god <reading>Ra</reading> (<ja>ら</ja>).

The <kanji>ravine</kanji> is still in <ja><reading>きょう</reading>と</ja> though, because if you went outside the city your marriage wouldn't be legal. So you found a secluded, local ravine.
