Okay, so a whale isn't technically a fish, but that's why it makes such a good leader. You can usually only find whales hanging around near the capital because they really enjoy ruling over all the other fish. They are the biggest, after all.	Picture the underwater fish capital. Statues of whales line the fishy streets, and all of the fish bow down to the whale ruler's giant body.	The <kanji>whale</kanji> who resides over the capital just happens to be <reading>gay</reading> (<ja>げい</ja>). You only know this because his husband is a man whale too. Actually, now that you think about it, all the whales you've ever met have been gay.	Picture the gay whale ruler holding whale hands... fins? with his whale husband. They're so cute.		8054	-	kanji Lesson_54

Picture the samurai's villa. It's in the countryside and covered in flowers and icicles. Even though it's spring, it's still cold, so all the new flowers are very cold.	Once the samurai enters the <kanji>villa</kanji>, he lets his <reading>soul</reading> (<ja>そう</ja>) go. He's been fighting for long enough and this villa was always where he wanted to go.	Picture the samurai sitting in a chair in his beautiful villa and breathing his last breath.

He wouldn't do this if he was sober, but drunk people can't help themselves.	He keeps <kanji>planting</kanji> and planting... a little too much.

You can't see anything about them, since they're all covered up. All you see is their angry mouth and the sword they keep putting near your fingers. 	Imagine you've been kidnapped. And the person who kidnapped you is going to cut off some of your fingers and mail them to your parents if they don't pay the ransom soon enough. You don't want your fingers to be cut off with a sword! Help!	You've been <kanji>kidnap</kanji>ped and your kidnapper has asked for one thing in exchange for your safe return: a <reading>ka</reading>yak (<ja>かい</ja>). Kayaks are expensive. And it's way easier for this dude to kidnap you and demand your family buy one and give it to them than for them to work for one.	If your parents don't send in the kayak to your kidnapper soon, you're gonna lose some fingers. Come on guys, just get the kayak already!!!		8057	-	kanji Lesson_54

If you measure somewhere else on your head for a crown it won't fit.	Imagine someone putting a tape measure around your forehead and taking careful measurements for your crown. They better not mess up, or you'll have them put to death!	You want your <kanji>crown</kanji> to be just like Genghis <reading>Khan</reading>'s (<ja>かん</ja>), which was more of a cap. He's your hero though, because he ruled over the most people, so you want yours to match his measurements.	Why don't you go look up what Genghis Khan's crown/cap looked like.

Most people in places heavy with power, like the scouts, boil down all of their responsibilities and accomplishments this way into merit badges.	The only problem with consolidating your <kanji>merit</kanji>s like this is that rac<reading>coon</reading>s (<ja>くん</ja>) are always trying to steal them. Raccoons really like shiny, small things. Like, say, the physical representation of all your personal and professional merits.	This is why you never see a military officer or a girl scout leaving their merit badges out in the open. They pin them right onto their clothes. Otherwise the raccoons would come.		8059	-	kanji Lesson_54

Now you have to <kanji>repay</kanji> them. Alcohol costs a lot of money, you know.	Picture yourself dropping the alcohol, drop by drop, into the river. Uh oh, the person just caught up to you, so you better repay them.	In order to <kanji>repay</kanji> them for the alcohol you wasted, you offer to give them your <reading>shoe</reading>s (<ja>しゅう</ja>). They don't want your shoes though, so you have to bring them to a store and watch them try on a bunch of different pairs so you can repay them that way.	Imagine waiting as this person tries on like twenty different pairs of shoes. They're getting them for free! Why do they have to be picky?! Just let me repay you already!		8060	-	kanji Lesson_54

Everyone's so busy eating and working and being at school, that they miss this awesome deal, but not you. Everyday at noon you stock up on wholesale stamps. Do you send a lot of mail? No, you probably just collect them. But they were cheap, so who cares!	Imagine yourself stopping at the empty bank at noon, grabbing a handful of wholesale stamps. So many stamps. So few extra charges.	"Oh, one more thing. Going at noon isn't enough, you have to say the password to get them at <kanji>wholesale</kanji> price too. The password is ""<reading>Oh Roshi</reading>"" (<ja>おろし</ja>). Okay, so maybe that's just the name of the guy there, but it always works when I want to get stamps wholesale so you should do it too!"	"""Oh Roshi"" you say carefully as you hand your stamps over at noon. The guy raises an eyebrow at you, but gives you them wholesale! It worked! "		8062	-	kanji Lesson_54

茎	Kanji	艹, 圣	Flowers, Tombstone	radical, radical	Stem	Stem		きょう けい	<reading>くき</reading>			くき	きょう, けい								When you leave <radical>flowers</radical> on a <radical>tombstone</radical> they look good at first, but after a few days or some harsh weather, there's nothing left but <kanji>stem</kanji>s. That's why you have to replace flowers on tombstones all the time. If you don't it will look like you only left the stems there, and that's pretty disrespectful.	Imagine being in a graveyard looking at all the tombstones and seeing nothing but stems on all of them. All the pretty flowery parts have died and blown away.	You have an idea that can make these tombstones look better than just having leftover <kanji>stem</kanji>s all over them. You brought <reading>cookie</reading>s (<ja>くき</ja>)! Cookies don't fall apart in the wind, and everyone loves cookies, alive or dead. You replace the stems with the cookies and everything looks a lot nicer.	Look at all the cookie covered tombstones. Now your bag is full of stems, but you can use them to make more cookies to bring back next time. Don't worry, nobody eats them. Stem cookies are probably poisonous.		8083	-	kanji Lesson_54

An <kanji>apricot</kanji>! Apricots are also about the size of an open mouth, so they kind of look like mouths hanging down under the trees. You can bite them right off the tree with your own mouth!	Picture the mouth sized apricots hanging down off the tree. Imagine using your own mouth to bite them down. Just don't swallow the pit!	After you put the <kanji>apricot</kanji> in your mouth you realize that this tastes really familiar, but not pleasant. It tastes just like the <reading>an</reading>chovies (<ja>あん</ja>) from the <reading>zoo</reading> (<ja>ず</ja>) smell. How did that happen? You don't like apricots anymore.

That's why red flowers that grow in the west are used to make <kanji>red dye</kanji>. They're the closest to the actual color of the red sun, so they're prized by painters and other artists for their perfect color for dye.	Picture yourself sitting in the west as the red sun sets, smashing those pretty red flowers into a paste to make red dye. Your fingers get dyed red too and you crush the petals into a paste.	"As you're smashing the flowers into <kanji>red dye</kanji>, a little girl comes up to you and points at the paste. She says, ""<ja><reading>赤ね</reading></ja> (<ja>あかね</ja>)?"" (That's red, right?)

To be fair, books are just dry trees in a way, but bookmarks are actually dry, dry trees that have flattened out and turned into chunks.	"What are you bookmarking anyway?
